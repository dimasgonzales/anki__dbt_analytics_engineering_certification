<front>

You exist in a development environment where `model_a` already exists. You run the following command:

```bash
dbt run --select model_b --defer --state path/to/prod
```

If `model_a` is an upstream parent of `model_b`, which schema will `model_b` select `model_a` from: development or production?

</front>

<back>

It will select from **development**.

Even with `--defer`, dbt prioritizes the current environment if the object exists there. To force dbt to use the production version from the state manifest despite the model existing locally, you would need to add the `--favor-state` flag.
