  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer correctly identifies that dbt uses atomic replacement to prevent downtime during model rebuilds. The reference text explicitly confirms this by stating that dbt ensures relations are replaced atomically to avoid downtime for business users."

dbt uses **atomic replacement**. It builds the new model definition in a temporary object (or uses a rename strategy) and only swaps it with the production object once the build is successful. This ensures the object always exists.
