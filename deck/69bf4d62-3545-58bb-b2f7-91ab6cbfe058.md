<front>

What specific subset of the DAG does the selector syntax `+model_a,+model_b` identify?

</front>

<back>

This syntax identifies the **shared upstream dependencies** (common ancestors) of both `model_a` and `model_b`. It calculates the intersection of "all ancestors of A" and "all ancestors of B".
