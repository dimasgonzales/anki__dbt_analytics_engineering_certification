  verdict: CONTRADICTED
  explanation: "The reference text supports the commands `dbt invocation list` and `dbt reattach` as mentioned in the answer, but it contradicts `dbt invocation cancel <id>` by explicitly stating that active sessions are canceled using the `Ctrl + Z` shortcut, not through the specified command with an <id> parameter. This indicates that the method for canceling sessions differs from what is described in the answer."
