  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The Reference Text mentions the 'invocation' and 'reattach' commands in the context of session management but does not specify the exact subcommands 'list' and 'cancel' under 'invocation', nor their full syntax as presented in the Answer. Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the accuracy of the Answer's three specific commands."
