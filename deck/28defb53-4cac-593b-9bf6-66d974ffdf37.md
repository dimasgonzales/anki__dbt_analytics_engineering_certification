<front>

You are optimizing a CI pipeline to save time. You want to run tests ONLY on modified models and their immediate downstream dependencies. what selector pattern should you use?

<back>

Use `state:modified+`.

```bash
dbt test --select state:modified+
```

The `+` operator selects the modified models and everything downstream of them to ensure changes didn't break dependent views or tables.
