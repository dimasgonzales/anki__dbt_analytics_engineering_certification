  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text indicates that dbt creates snapshot tables as clones with added meta-fields, and in re-snapshotting, existing tables are dropped and recreated rather than altered, supporting the answer's claim that dbt does not automatically alter tables and requires manual steps when meta-fields are missing."
  citation:
    quote: "re-snapshotting your source data as if it was the first time by dropping your 'snapshot' which isn't a real snapshot table. Then dbt snapshot will create a new snapshot and insert the snapshot meta-fields as expected."

<front>

Does dbt automatically alter a standard table to add snapshot meta-columns (like `dbt_valid_from`) if you convert a model into a snapshot?

**No.** dbt will not automatically alter an existing standard table to match snapshot structure.

If dbt encounters a table without the required meta-fields, it will fail execution rather than attempting to alter the schema, requiring manual intervention.
