<front>

What specific artifact does dbt require to enable deferral, and which CLI flag is used to point to it?

</front>

<back>

Deferral requires the **`manifest.json`** artifact from a previous run (usually production).

You point to the directory containing this artifact using the `--state` flag or by setting the `DBT_STATE` environment variable.
