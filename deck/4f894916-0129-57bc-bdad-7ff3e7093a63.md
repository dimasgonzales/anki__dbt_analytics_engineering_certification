  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly supports that deferral requires the manifest.json artifact and uses the --state flag to point to it. The text mentions the manifest and the --state flag, aligning with the answer. The part about the DBT_STATE environment variable is not mentioned in the reference text but does not contradict it, and the core claim is verified."

    quote: "If `--defer-state` is not specified, deferral will use the manifest supplied to `--state`."

<front>

What specific artifact does dbt require to enable deferral, and which CLI flag is used to point to it?

<back>

Deferral requires the **`manifest.json`** artifact from a previous run (usually production).

You point to the directory containing this artifact using the `--state` flag or by setting the `DBT_STATE` environment variable.
