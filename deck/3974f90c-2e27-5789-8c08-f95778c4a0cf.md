<front>

You are debugging a macro and want to write detailed trace information to `dbt.log` without cluttering the terminal output during a `dbt run`. How should you structure your log command?

Use the `log` function with `info=False` (or omit the argument, as `False` is the default). This directs the output solely to the log file.

```jinja
{{ log("Detailed trace info", info=False) }}
```

</back>
