  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly indicates that row-level access, masking policies (column-level), and future grants are not supported by the standard dbt `grants` resource config and require the use of hooks, directly confirming the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "For example, hooks may be appropriate if you want to: * Create more granular row- and column-level access, use masking policies, or apply future grants."
