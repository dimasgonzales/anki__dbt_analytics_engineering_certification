<front>

Your organization's file system standards require all external code dependencies to be stored in a folder named `vendor_libs`. How do you configure dbt to comply with this requirement?

<back>

Add the `packages-install-path` key to your `dbt_project.yml` file and set the value to `"vendor_libs"`.

```yaml
packages-install-path: "vendor_libs"
```
When you run `dbt deps`, dbt will install packages into this specific directory instead of `dbt_packages`.
