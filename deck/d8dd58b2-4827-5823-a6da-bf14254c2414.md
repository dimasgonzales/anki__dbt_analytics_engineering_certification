  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text includes examples where data tests involving multiple columns are defined at the model level under 'data_tests:', parallel to 'columns:'. Specifically, the 'unique_combination_of_columns' test is shown in this configuration, which aligns with the answer's claim for tests comparing two columns."

<front>

In a `.yml` file, where should you define a test that compares two columns within the same row (e.g., `start_date < end_date`)?

This should be defined as a **model-level** test, located directly under `data_tests:` (or `tests:`), parallel to the `columns:` key. It is not nested under a specific column because it involves multiple columns.
