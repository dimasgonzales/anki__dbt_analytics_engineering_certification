<front>

In a `.yml` file, where should you define a test that compares two columns within the same row (e.g., `start_date < end_date`)?

This should be defined as a **model-level** test, located directly under `data_tests:` (or `tests:`), parallel to the `columns:` key. It is not nested under a specific column because it involves multiple columns.
