<front>

Why do incremental models typically execute as full refreshes in standard CI/CD pipelines?

<back>

Standard CI jobs usually build into empty temporary schemas where the destination tables do not yet exist. When dbt cannot find an existing relation in the database, it defaults to a full refresh strategy (creating the table), meaning the `is_incremental()` macro evaluates to `false` and incremental logic is skipped.
