  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text confirms that in CI/CD pipelines, incremental models typically do not exist in temporary schemas, leading to full refreshes when dbt cannot find existing relations, which aligns with the answer's description."
  citation:
    quote: "For brand new incremental models, you want them to run in `full-refresh` mode in CI, because they will run in `full-refresh` mode in production when the PR is merged into `main`. They also don't exist yet in the production environment... they're brand new!"

<front>

Why do incremental models typically execute as full refreshes in standard CI/CD pipelines?

<back>

Standard CI jobs usually build into empty temporary schemas where the destination tables do not yet exist. When dbt cannot find an existing relation in the database, it defaults to a full refresh strategy (creating the table), meaning the `is_incremental()` macro evaluates to `false` and incremental logic is skipped.
