  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that Fusion tracks which columns are used where to ensure models are rebuilt only when necessary, directly supporting the answer's claim about column-level lineage improving upon standard state:modified logic."

How does State-Aware Orchestration in dbt Fusion improve upon standard `state:modified` logic regarding downstream dependencies?

It utilizes **column-level lineage** rather than just file timestamps or hashes. Fusion checks if the specific columns used by downstream models have changed; if a modification is limited to an unused column, Fusion avoids rebuilding the downstream dependencies, saving compute resources.
