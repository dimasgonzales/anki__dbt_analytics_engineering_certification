  explanation: "The reference text discusses exposures in the context of dbt Catalog and DAG, mentioning how they appear and can be referenced, but it does not explicitly define what an exposure is or state its primary purpose as described in the answer. Specifically, it does not confirm that exposures are YAML-defined resources representing downstream consumers like dashboards or notebooks, nor detail their primary purpose for tracking lineage, documenting ownership, or linking to external tools."

What is an 'exposure' in dbt and what is its primary purpose?

</front>

<back>

An exposure is a resource defined in YAML that represents a downstream consumer of your dbt project, such as a dashboard, notebook, or reverse ETL sync. Its primary purpose is to add these external assets to the dbt DAG, allowing you to track lineage, document ownership, and link to the external tool.
