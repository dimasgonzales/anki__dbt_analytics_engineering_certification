What is an 'exposure' in dbt and what is its primary purpose?

</front>

<back>

An exposure is a resource defined in YAML that represents a downstream consumer of your dbt project, such as a dashboard, notebook, or reverse ETL sync. Its primary purpose is to add these external assets to the dbt DAG, allowing you to track lineage, document ownership, and link to the external tool.
