<front>
How can you modify the conditions under which tests will produce errors or warnings?
</front>

<back>

Via a config block, either in the relevant yaml file (for generic tests) or as a jinja config block in a singular test's sql file. The `severity` option determines the default behavior of a test failure (either "error" or "warn"), while the `error/warn_if` options take a calculation string to determine a "failed record threshold" that determines the behavior. E.g. `error_if: >30` means the test will only throw an error if more than 30 records fail.
