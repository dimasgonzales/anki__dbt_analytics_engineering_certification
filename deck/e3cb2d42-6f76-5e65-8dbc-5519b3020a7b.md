<front>

In dbt, if a model is configured as a `table` in `dbt_project.yml` but as a `view` inside the model file using the `config()` macro, how will it materialize?

<back>

It will materialize as a **view**. In-file configurations set via the `{{ config() }}` macro always take precedence over configurations defined in `dbt_project.yml`.
