  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text mentions that materializations can be configured directly inside model SQL files as an alternative to dbt_project.yml, but it does not provide explicit information on whether in-file configurations take precedence over those defined in dbt_project.yml. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to verify the answer's claim about precedence."

<front>

In dbt, if a model is configured as a `table` in `dbt_project.yml` but as a `view` inside the model file using the `config()` macro, how will it materialize?

</front>

<back>

It will materialize as a **view**. In-file configurations set via the `{{ config() }}` macro always take precedence over configurations defined in `dbt_project.yml`.
