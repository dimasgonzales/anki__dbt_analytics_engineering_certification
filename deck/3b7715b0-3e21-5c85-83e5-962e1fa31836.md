<front>

In dbt node selection syntax, what is the difference between placing the '+' operator before a model name versus after it?

<back>

Placing the `+` **before** the model name (`+model`) selects the model and all its **upstream** ancestors (parents). 

Placing the `+` **after** the model name (`model+`) selects the model and all its **downstream** descendants (children).
