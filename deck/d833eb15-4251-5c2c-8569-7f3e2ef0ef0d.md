  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that dbt seed defaults to truncating and reinserting data to preserve the table object, and that the --full-refresh flag is required for column changes to force a drop and rebuild."
  citation:
    quote: "When you typically run dbt seed, dbt truncates the existing table and reinserts the data. However, when column names are changed, or new columns are added, these statements will fail as the table structure has changed. The `--full-refresh` flag will force dbt to `drop cascade` the existing table before rebuilding it."

What happens by default when you run `dbt seed` against an existing table, and what command flag is required if the CSV columns have changed?

<back>

By default, dbt performs a TRUNCATE and INSERT to update data while preserving the table object. If columns change, you must use `--full-refresh` to force a DROP and CREATE.
