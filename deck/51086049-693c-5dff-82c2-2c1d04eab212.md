  explanation: "The reference text extensively describes indirect selection and its modes (eager, cautious, buildable, empty), which aligns with the indirect part of the answer by indicating that indirect selection involves selecting tests based on selected resources. However, the text does not explicitly define or provide sufficient evidence to verify the direct selection part of the answer, which claims direct selection targets test nodes via attributes like name, type, or tags. The provided evidence focuses on indirect selection and resource-based selection, leaving the distinction incomplete for full verification."

<front>

In the context of dbt selector logic, what is the difference between 'Direct' and 'Indirect' selection?

<back>

**Direct selection** targets the test node itself via attributes like name, type, or tags.

**Indirect selection** targets the resource (model, seed, source) the test is attached to, implicitly including the associated tests.
