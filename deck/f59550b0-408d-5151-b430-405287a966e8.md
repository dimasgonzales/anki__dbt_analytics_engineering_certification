  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that in dbt versions 1.4 and higher, attempting to set a materialized value other than 'snapshot' raises a Parsing Error, directly supporting the answer."

What occurs if you attempt to define `materialized='table'` inside the `{{ config(...) }}` block of a dbt snapshot file?

It raises a **Parsing Error** (in dbt v1.4+). Snapshots have a strict internal materialization strategy.

Snapshots cannot be overridden to be tables or views via the config block; doing so historically broke SCD Type 2 logic and is now explicitly forbidden.
