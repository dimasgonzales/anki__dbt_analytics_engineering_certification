  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly states that 'Python models can't be materialized as view or ephemeral' and support only 'table' and 'incremental' materializations, which supports the limitation part of the Answer. However, it does not contain any information or mention of the `dbt.config()` method for setting configurations in Python models, leaving part of the Answer unverified. Therefore, there is not enough information to fully support the entire Answer."

<front>

How do you set configurations for a Python model in dbt, and what implies a critical limitation compared to SQL models?

<back>

You use the `dbt.config()` method inside the model function. A critical limitation is that Python models **cannot** be materialized as views; they are typically materialized as tables or incremental models.

Example:
```python
def model(dbt, session):
    dbt.config(materialized="table")
    ...
```
