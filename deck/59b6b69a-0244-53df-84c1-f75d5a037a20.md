How do you set configurations for a Python model in dbt, and what implies a critical limitation compared to SQL models?

You use the `dbt.config()` method inside the model function. A critical limitation is that Python models **cannot** be materialized as views; they are typically materialized as tables or incremental models.

Example:
```python
def model(dbt, session):
    dbt.config(materialized="table")
    ...
```
