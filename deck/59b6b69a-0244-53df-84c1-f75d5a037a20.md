  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The answer correctly states that configurations for Python models are set using the dbt.config() method, which is supported by the reference text. However, the claim about a critical limitation—that Python models cannot be materialized as views—is not addressed or verified in the provided text."

How do you set configurations for a Python model in dbt, and what implies a critical limitation compared to SQL models?

You use the `dbt.config()` method inside the model function. A critical limitation is that Python models **cannot** be materialized as views; they are typically materialized as tables or incremental models.

Example:
```python
def model(dbt, session):
    dbt.config(materialized="table")
    ...
```
