  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that staging models should not have joins and that any joins should occur in intermediate and mart models, which directly aligns with the answer provided."
  citation:
    quote: "Where you will not (and should not) see inner joins is in [staging models](/best-practices/how-we-structure/2-staging) that are used to clean and prep raw source data for analytics uses. Any joins in your dbt projects should happen further downstream in [intermediate](/best-practices/how-we-structure/3-intermediate) and [mart models](/best-practices/how-we-structure/4-marts) to improve modularity and DAG cleanliness."

<front>

In the context of dbt project structure, which layers should contain joins and which layer should generally avoid them?

<back>

Joins should be restricted to the **intermediate** and **marts** layers. The **staging** layer should be reserved for 1:1 cleaning and preparation of source data without joining to other entities to maintain DAG cleanliness and modularity.
