<front>

You added a new model to your dbt project and immediately ran `dbt docs generate`. The documentation site works, but your new model shows "No columns found". What is the likely cause and solution?

</front>

<back>

The model has likely not been materialized in the warehouse yet. `dbt docs generate` relies on existing warehouse objects to populate column details in `catalog.json`.

**Solution:** Run the model first, then regenerate docs:
```bash
$ dbt run --select my_new_model
$ dbt docs generate
```

</back>
