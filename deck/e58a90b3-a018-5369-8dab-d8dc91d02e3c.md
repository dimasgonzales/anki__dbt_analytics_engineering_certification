<front>

Which three directories are standard exclusions in a dbt project's `.gitignore` file?

</front>

<back>

1. `target/` (compiled SQL and build artifacts)
2. `dbt_packages/` (external dependencies)
3. `logs/` (run logs)

These folders contain generated files that should not be version-controlled.
