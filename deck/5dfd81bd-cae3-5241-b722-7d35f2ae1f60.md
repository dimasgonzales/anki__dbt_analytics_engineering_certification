<front>

You are implementing dbt Mesh and need to restrict access to a set of finance models so they are owned by the finance team and not accidentally referenced by other teams. How do you start this process?

Define a group in `dbt_project.yml` with owner details, then apply that group to the specific models or folder.

```yaml
groups:
  - name: finance
    owner: {email: 'finance@example.com'}
```
