<front>

You are orchestrating a production pipeline where `model_B` depends on `model_A`. If `model_A` runs successfully but fails its unique test, how will `dbt build` handle `model_B` compared to running `dbt run && dbt test`?

</front>

<back>

In `dbt build`, `model_B` will be **skipped** because its upstream dependency (the test on `model_A`) failed.

In the command chain `dbt run && dbt test`, `model_B` would likely have already run during the `dbt run` step before the test failure on `model_A` occurred in the subsequent step.
