<front>

You are creating a model named `users.sql` in a package named `marketing_analytics`. Why might this naming convention cause issues when installed in a client project?

<back>

It creates a namespace collision risk. If the client project (or another installed package) also has a model named `users`, dbt may raise an error or behavior becomes ambiguous.

**Solution:** Prefix the model with the package name, e.g., `marketing_analytics_users.sql`.
