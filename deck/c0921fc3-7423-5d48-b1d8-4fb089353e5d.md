<front>

You are trying to upgrade dbt versions and want to disable a deprecated behavior using a CLI flag like `dbt run --legacy-feature false`, but it is not working. Why?

Behavior change flags generally cannot be toggled via the CLI.

These settings are intended to be consistent across the project and version-controlled, so they must be defined under the `flags:` key in your `dbt_project.yml` file.
