  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that runtime file paths such as --state or --log-path cannot be set in dbt_project.yml and must be configured using CLI options or environment variables, which directly matches the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "Flags setting file paths: Flags for file paths that are relevant to runtime execution (for example, `--log-path` or `--state`) cannot be set in `dbt_project.yml`. To override defaults, pass CLI options or set environment variables (`DBT_LOG_PATH`, `DBT_STATE`)."

<front>

Which two methods must be used to configure runtime paths, such as `--state` or `--log-path`?

1. **CLI Arguments**: e.g., `dbt run --state path/to/artifacts`
2. **Environment Variables**: e.g., `export DBT_STATE='path/to/artifacts'`

These values define the *execution environment*, not the project structure, so they cannot be defined in YAML files.
