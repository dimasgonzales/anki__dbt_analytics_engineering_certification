<front>

You are debugging a lineage graph in dbt Docs and want to visualize ONLY the `fct_orders` model and all of its upstream dependencies. What would you type into the lineage filter bar?

<back>

You would type:
```bash
+fct_orders
```
This standard selector syntax isolates the model plus all of its parents (upstream dependencies), effectively filtering out unrelated nodes from the visualization.
