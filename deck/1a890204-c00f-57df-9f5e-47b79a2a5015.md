  explanation: "The reference text discusses general aspects of Python models in dbt, such as their capabilities, drawbacks, and prerequisites, but it does not explicitly mention or specify any primary use cases for using Python models instead of SQL. There is no evidence supporting or contradicting the listed use cases of Machine Learning, Complex Math, or Library Usage."

<front>

What are the three primary use cases where dbt recommends using Python models instead of SQL?

</front>

1. **Machine Learning:** Training models or running predictions.
2. **Complex Math:** Advanced statistics or matrix operations difficult in SQL.
3. **Library Usage:** Parsing difficult data formats using libraries like `dateutil` or `numpy`.
