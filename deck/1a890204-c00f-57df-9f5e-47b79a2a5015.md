  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly lists model training and predictive models (aligning with machine learning), matrix operations (aligning with complex math), and Python packages for complex transformations (aligning with library usage, with an example using dateutil), supporting the answer's three primary use cases."

    quote: "Use Python when it is better suited for the job – model training, using predictive models, matrix operations, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and Python packages that can assist with complex transformations."

What are the three primary use cases where dbt recommends using Python models instead of SQL?

</front>

<back>

1. **Machine Learning:** Training models or running predictions.
2. **Complex Math:** Advanced statistics or matrix operations difficult in SQL.
3. **Library Usage:** Parsing difficult data formats using libraries like `dateutil` or `numpy`.
