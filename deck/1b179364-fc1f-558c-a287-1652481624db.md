  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that runtime file path flags like --log-path or --state cannot be configured in the flags dictionary of dbt_project.yml and must be set via CLI options or environment variables, supporting the answer's claim that they are restricted due to environmental variation."
  citation:
    quote: "Flags for file paths that are relevant to runtime execution (for example, `--log-path` or `--state`) cannot be set in `dbt_project.yml`. To override defaults, pass CLI options or set environment variables (`DBT_LOG_PATH`, `DBT_STATE`)."

<front>

Why can runtime file paths, such as `--state` or `--log-path`, NOT be configured in the `flags` dictionary of `dbt_project.yml`?

<back>

These configurations depend on the execution environment (specific file system paths) which varies between machines and users. Therefore, dbt restricts these to **CLI arguments** or **Environment Variables** only.
