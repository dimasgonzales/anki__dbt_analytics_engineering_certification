<front>

Why can runtime file paths, such as `--state` or `--log-path`, NOT be configured in the `flags` dictionary of `dbt_project.yml`?

These configurations depend on the execution environment (specific file system paths) which varies between machines and users. Therefore, dbt restricts these to **CLI arguments** or **Environment Variables** only.
