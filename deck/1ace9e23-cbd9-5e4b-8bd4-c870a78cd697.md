What are the three access levels available for dbt models and what is the scope of each?

The three access levels are:
1. **Private**: The model can only be referenced by models within the same group.
2. **Protected** (Default): The model can be referenced by any model within the same project or package.
3. **Public**: The model can be referenced across different projects (essential for dbt Mesh).
