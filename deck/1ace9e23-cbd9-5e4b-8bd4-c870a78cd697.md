  explanation: "The reference text explicitly defines Private and Protected access modifiers with scopes that match the answer, confirming those parts. However, it does not define or mention the Public access modifier or its scope as described in the answer. The text refers to 'public model' in the context of visibility in dbt Mesh, not in relation to model access modifiers for referencing."

What are the three access levels available for dbt models and what is the scope of each?

The three access levels are:
1. **Private**: The model can only be referenced by models within the same group.
2. **Protected** (Default): The model can be referenced by any model within the same project or package.
3. **Public**: The model can be referenced across different projects (essential for dbt Mesh).
