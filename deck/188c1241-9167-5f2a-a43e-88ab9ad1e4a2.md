<front>

Which dbt command allows you to verify exactly which resources a selector will target without actually executing the job?

<back>

The `dbt ls` (list) command.

```bash
dbt ls --select [selector_syntax]
```

It accepts the same selection flags as run/test/seed and outputs the list of matching resources to the console.
