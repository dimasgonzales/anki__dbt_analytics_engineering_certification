  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that the 'dbt ls (list)' command accepts '--selector' and other selection flags, which supports the answer that it can be used to verify which resources a selector will target without executing the job."

<front>

Which dbt command allows you to verify exactly which resources a selector will target without actually executing the job?

<back>

The `dbt ls` (list) command.

```bash
dbt ls --select [selector_syntax]
```

It accepts the same selection flags as run/test/seed and outputs the list of matching resources to the console.
