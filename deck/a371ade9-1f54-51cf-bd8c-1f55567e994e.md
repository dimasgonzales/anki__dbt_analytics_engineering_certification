<front>

You have a SQL model returning columns `id`, `status`, and `created_at`. You enable contracts but only define `id` and `status` in the YAML. What happens when you run `dbt build`?

</front>

---

<back>

The build fails immediately with a contract error. When `enforced: true` is set, dbt performs a preflight check to ensure the YAML schema matches the SQL query results exactly. Missing column definitions in the YAML are not allowed.
