<front>

You are configuring a CI job and need to run `dim_customers`, ensure all its downstream models run, and ensure that any *other* upstream parents of those downstream models are also built. Which selector command should you use?

</front>

<back>

Use the `@` operator.

```bash
dbt build --select @dim_customers
```

This ensures the "impact zone" is fully covered by building the model, its parents, its children, and the parents of those children.
