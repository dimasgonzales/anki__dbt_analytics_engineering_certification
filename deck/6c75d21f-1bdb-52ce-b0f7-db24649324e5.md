What is the primary purpose of using `incremental_predicates` in a dbt model configuration?

<back>

`incremental_predicates` allows you to inject custom SQL conditions (usually involving the destination table alias) into the `MERGE` statement.
Its primary purpose is performance optimization on large tables by limiting the scan of the **destination** (existing) table, rather than just filtering the source data.
