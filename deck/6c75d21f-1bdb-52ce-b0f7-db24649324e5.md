  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly states that incremental_predicates is used for performance optimization with large data volumes and involves limiting the scan of the existing table, which aligns with the Answer's claims about injecting custom SQL conditions for performance by reducing destination table scans."
  citation:
    quote: "incremental_predicates is an advanced use of incremental models, where data volume is large enough to justify additional investments in performance."

<front>

What is the primary purpose of using `incremental_predicates` in a dbt model configuration?

<back>

`incremental_predicates` allows you to inject custom SQL conditions (usually involving the destination table alias) into the `MERGE` statement.
Its primary purpose is performance optimization on large tables by limiting the scan of the **destination** (existing) table, rather than just filtering the source data.
