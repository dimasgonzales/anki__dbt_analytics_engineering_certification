<front>
What **dbt\_project.yml** field is used to specify a custom list of directories where seed files are located? What is the default? What are some use cases?

**seed-paths**. The default is `seeds`. You can use this option to:  

1. put your seed files in a non-default directory (e.g. "/custom\_seeds/")
2. Co-locate your models and seeds in the *same* directory (which works because of the different file types involved, .csv vs .sql)
3. Split your seeds across multiple directories. Note that dbtlabs recommends just using subdirectories within the default "seeds" dir in most cases instead of this option.
