<front>

You are using dbt Cloud and want to build a custom external dashboard that tracks the duration of your production runs over time. How should you retrieve this data?

<back>

You should use the **dbt Cloud Admin API** (or Metadata API).

Instead of parsing flat files, you would make GET requests to the API endpoints (e.g., retrieving runs by account/job ID) to get structured, programmatic access to historical run metadata.
