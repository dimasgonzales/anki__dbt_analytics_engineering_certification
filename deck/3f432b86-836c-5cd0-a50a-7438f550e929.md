<front>

Your dbt project materializes models into two different databases: `raw_lake` and `analytics_wh`. You need to grant usage on all created schemas in an `on-run-end` hook. Which variable should you use and why?

</front>

<back>

You should use `database_schemas`. Since the project spans multiple databases, using the simple `schemas` list would lose the database context, potentially leading to grants on the wrong database or syntax errors.

Usage:
```jinja
{% for (database, schema) in database_schemas %}
```

</back>
