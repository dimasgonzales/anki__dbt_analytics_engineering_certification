<front>

You need to select all columns from the `stg_payments` model except for the `credit_card_number` column to avoid exposing PII. How would you write this in dbt SQL?

<back>

You should use `dbt_utils.star` with the `except` list:

```sql
select
  {{ dbt_utils.star(from=ref('stg_payments'), except=['credit_card_number']) }}
from {{ ref('stg_payments') }}
```

</back>
