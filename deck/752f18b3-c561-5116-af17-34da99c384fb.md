<front>

You decide to reorganize your project by moving `orders.sql` from `models/core/` to `models/marts/`. Do you need to update the `ref('orders')` functions in your downstream models? Why or why not?

No, you do not need to update the references.

`ref()` functions look up models by their **unique model name** (filename), not their file path. While moving the file changes how configurations might apply via `dbt_project.yml`, it does not change how the DAG connects via `ref()`.
