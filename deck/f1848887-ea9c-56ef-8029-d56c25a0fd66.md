<front>

When defining source freshness configurations in dbt, how can you disable freshness checks for a specific table that would otherwise inherit a source-level configuration?

<back>

You can disable freshness checks for a specific table by setting the `freshness` key to `null` in that table's configuration block.

Example:
```yaml
tables:
  - name: historic_data
    config:
      freshness: null
```

</back>
