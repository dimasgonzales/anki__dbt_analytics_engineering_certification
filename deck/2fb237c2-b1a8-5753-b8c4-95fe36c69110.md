  explanation: "The reference text confirms that default configurations for subdirectories in dbt_project.yml are defined in the models: section by replicating the folder structure and using the + prefix for configs, as described in the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "We demarcate between a folder name and a configuration by using a `+`, so `marketing`, `paid_ads`, and `google` below are folder names, whereas **`+materialized` is a configuration** being applied to those folder and all folders nested below them."

<front>

How do you define default configurations (such as materialization) for a specific subdirectory of models in `dbt_project.yml`?

Navigate to the `models:` section, mimic your folder structure, and apply the configuration using the `+` prefix.

Example:
```yaml
models:
  my_project:
    marts:
      +materialized: table
```

</back>
