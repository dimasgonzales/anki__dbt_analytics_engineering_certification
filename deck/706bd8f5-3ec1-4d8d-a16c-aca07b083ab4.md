What does the `invalidate_hard_deletes` snapshot config option do?
</front>

---

<back>

When set to true, records that were deleted in the source table will be marked as no longer valid (i.e. will receive a non-null "end date") in the snapshot table. By default, this does not happen--if a record is deleted in the source table, its most recent instance in the snapshot table is not affected at all.
