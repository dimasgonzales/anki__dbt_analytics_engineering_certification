  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer correctly captures that the `--empty` flag forces refs and sources to return zero rows, validating dependencies and reducing compute cost by avoiding data reads, which aligns with the reference text's description."

<front>

What is the specific purpose of the `--empty` flag in dbt commands?

<back>

It allows for a "dry run" by forcing all `ref()` and `source()` dependencies to return zero rows. 

This validates the SQL syntax and DDL creation against the warehouse without incurring the compute cost or time required to process the actual data.
