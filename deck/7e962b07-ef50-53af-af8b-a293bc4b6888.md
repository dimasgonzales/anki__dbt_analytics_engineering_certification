  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly supports that inline SQL comments are for developers to explain complex code logic. It also indicates that database object-level comments, which can be managed via model descriptions in dbt (often in YAML), are for adding context or metadata, aligning with the purpose of YAML descriptions for business context and documentation."
  citation:
    quote: "In practice, you’ll likely see SQL comments at the beginning of complex code logic, to help future developers or even advanced business users understand what specific blocks of code are accomplishing."

According to dbt best practices, what is the specific purpose of inline SQL comments (e.g., `--` or `/* */`) versus YAML descriptions?

<back>

Inline SQL comments are for developers/maintainers to explain complex code logic, implementation details, or mark TODOs. YAML descriptions are for data consumers to understand business context and definitions via the generated documentation site.
