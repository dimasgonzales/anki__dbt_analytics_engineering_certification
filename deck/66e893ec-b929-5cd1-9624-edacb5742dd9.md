You are creating a model and need to: 1) Ensure the `id` column is unique, and 2) Define the model as an `incremental` build. How do you categorize and define these requirements?

1. **Uniqueness**: This is a **test (property)** defined in a YAML file under the `columns` key.
2. **Incremental**: This is a **configuration** defined using the `{{ config() }}` macro in the SQL file or under a `config` key in YAML.
