  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Answer is supported by the Reference Text, which explicitly states that dbt wraps SELECT statements in appropriate DDL or DML commands, aligning with the Answer's claim about wrapping the SELECT statement in DDL to create the object."
  citation:
    quote: "when dbt wraps your `select` statements in the appropriate DDL or DML, it will use the correct DML for your warehouse — all of this logic is written in to dbt."

<front>

You have a model configured with `materialized='table'` and contain only a `SELECT` statement. When you execute `dbt run`, what action does the dbt adapter actually perform against the warehouse?

<back>

The adapter wraps your `SELECT` statement in the appropriate DDL commands to create the object.

Conceptually, it executes:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE target_schema.model_name AS
SELECT ... -- your code here
```

</back>
