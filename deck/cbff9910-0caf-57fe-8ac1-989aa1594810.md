<front>

You have a model configured with `materialized='table'` and contain only a `SELECT` statement. When you execute `dbt run`, what action does the dbt adapter actually perform against the warehouse?

</front>

<back>

The adapter wraps your `SELECT` statement in the appropriate DDL commands to create the object.

Conceptually, it executes:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE target_schema.model_name AS
SELECT ... -- your code here
```

</back>
