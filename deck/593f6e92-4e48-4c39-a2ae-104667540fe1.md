<front>
How can you reference a built-in dbt Jinja method from within an overriding, custom implementation of that same method? What methods can be referenced in this way?

`builtins.<method_name>`. This only works for three methods:
  

- ref
- source
- config

This is maybe conceptually analogous to how super() is used in Python.

Example:

```
{% macro ref(model_name) %}
 {% set rel = builtins.ref(model_name) %}
 {% set newrel = rel.replace_path(database="dev") %}
 {% do return(newrel) %}
{% endmacro %}
```

</back>
