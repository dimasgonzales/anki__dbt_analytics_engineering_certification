  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text describes accessing stdout and debug logs via the System Logs toggle in the Invocation History Drawer within the Studio IDE, but does not mention the 'Run Summary tab' or 'job run' as specified in the answer, so there is insufficient information to verify or contradict the claim."
  citation:
    quote: "**System Logs toggle —** The System Logs toggle, located under the Invocation Summary, allows the user to see the full stdout and debug logs for the entirety of the invoked command."

In dbt Cloud, where can you find the detailed `stdout` and `stderr` logs for specific execution steps, such as `dbt run` or `git clone`?

<back>

In the **Run Summary** tab of a job run. You can expand individual steps (e.g., the failed `dbt build` step) to view the raw console logs, which contain specific SQL errors or Jinja compilation issues necessary for troubleshooting.
