  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer correctly describes intermediate models as breaking down complex transformations and allowing logic isolation, which is explicitly supported by the reference text. However, the terms 'Intermediate Representations (IR)' and 'validate data states' are not mentioned in the text, but they do not contradict it, and the core concepts align with the stated purposes."

    quote: "Intermediate models serve to break up complexity from our marts models, and their purposes can take as many forms as data transformation might require. Some common use cases of intermediate models include: Isolating complex operations: moving any particularly complex or difficult to understand pieces of logic into their own intermediate models."

In the context of dbt project structure, what is the purpose of an 'intermediate model'?

<back>

Intermediate models act as **Intermediate Representations (IR)** that break down complex transformations into manageable steps. They sit between source data and final marts, allowing you to isolate logic, validate data states, and simplify the final downstream models.
