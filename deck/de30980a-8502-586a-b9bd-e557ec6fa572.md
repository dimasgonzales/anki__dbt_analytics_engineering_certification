<front>

You have changed the data type of a column in an existing incremental model and need to update the table structure in the warehouse. How should you execute dbt to handle this?

<back>

Run `dbt run --full-refresh`. 

Standard incremental runs often fail or result in schema mismatches when columns change. The `--full-refresh` flag drops the existing table and recreates it entirely with the new schema.
