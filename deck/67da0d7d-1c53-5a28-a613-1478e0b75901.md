<front>

A record was deleted from your source system, but in your dbt snapshot, the `dbt_valid_to` field for that record is still `NULL`. What is the likely cause?

<back>

The snapshot is likely missing the `hard_deletes: 'new_record'` configuration. By default, snapshots do not invalidate records that are removed from the source; you must strictly opt-in to track hard deletes.
