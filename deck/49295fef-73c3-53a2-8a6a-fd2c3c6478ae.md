<front>

You need to restrict access to a specific table based on IAM conditions (e.g., environment=prod) and also mask PII in the `email` column. Which two features should you use?

<back>

Use `resource_tags` in the model config for the IAM table-level access restriction, and `policy_tags` in the `schema.yml` for the column-level masking.

```yaml
# schema.yml
columns:
  - name: email
    policy_tags: ['.../pii_masked']
```

</back>
