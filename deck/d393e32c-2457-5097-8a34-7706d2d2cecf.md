  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that macros from external packages must be qualified by prefixing with the package name to avoid issues, which directly supports the answer."

<front>

You have installed the `dbt_utils` package and want to use its `star` macro in your model. How do you correctly reference this macro to avoid compilation errors?

<back>

You must namespace the macro using the package name followed by a dot.

Example:
```sql
SELECT {{ dbt_utils.star(from=ref('my_model')) }} FROM ...
```
Without the `dbt_utils.` prefix, dbt may look for the macro only in your local project and fail.
