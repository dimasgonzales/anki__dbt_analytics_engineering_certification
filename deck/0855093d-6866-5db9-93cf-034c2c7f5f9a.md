<front>

You need to clone an entire production schema to a development environment quickly. Given that clone operations are independent of each other, how can you optimize execution time?

Increase the **`--threads`** count.

Since cloning tables (especially zero-copy) is a metadata operation and models do not depend on each other during the clone step, increasing parallelism significantly speeds up the process.

```bash
dbt clone --state prod-artifacts/ --threads 16
```
