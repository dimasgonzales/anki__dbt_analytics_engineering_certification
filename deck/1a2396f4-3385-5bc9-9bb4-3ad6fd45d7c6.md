<front>

You attempt to run a job using `state:modified` but receive an error that the state cannot be found. How would you troubleshoot this?

Verify that you are providing the `--state` flag and that it points to a valid directory containing the `manifest.json` from a reference run (usually production). 

Example:
```bash
dbt run --select state:modified --state ./path/to/artifacts
```
