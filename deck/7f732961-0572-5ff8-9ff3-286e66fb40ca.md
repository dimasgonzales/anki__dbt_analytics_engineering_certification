<front>

In what order does `dbt build` execute unit tests, data tests, and model materialization for a specific resource?

1. **Unit Tests** (Logic validation)
2. **Model Materialization** (Create table/view)
3. **Data Tests** (Integrity validation)

dbt ensures logic is correct before creating the object, and the object exists before checking data integrity.
