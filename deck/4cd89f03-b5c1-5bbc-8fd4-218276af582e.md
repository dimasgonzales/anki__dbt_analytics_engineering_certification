  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly supports the answer by stating that views have low build time but higher query time due to processing logic on each query, while tables have higher build time but lower query time as data is pre-computed and stored."
  citation:
    quote: "Views build almost instantly and cost almost nothing to build, but have to be processed every time they’re queried, so slower to return results than a table of the same data. Tables can take a long time to rebuild, especially for complex transformations, but are fast to query."

<front>

What is the primary trade-off between `view` and `table` materializations regarding build time vs. query time?

<back>

Views have near-zero build time but higher query time/cost because the transformation logic runs every time the view is accessed. Tables have higher build time/cost (as data is physically written) but lower query time/cost because the data is pre-computed.
