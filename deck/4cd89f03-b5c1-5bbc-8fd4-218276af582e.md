<front>

What is the primary trade-off between `view` and `table` materializations regarding build time vs. query time?

Views have near-zero build time but higher query time/cost because the transformation logic runs every time the view is accessed. Tables have higher build time/cost (as data is physically written) but lower query time/cost because the data is pre-computed.
