  explanation: "The reference text supports backward compatibility for dbt versions (v1.10 source) and indicates strict version matching for manifest.json, which implies it is not forward-compatible, aligning with the answer's claims."

<front>

Is the `manifest.json` file in dbt forward-compatible or backward-compatible?

<back>

dbt is generally **backward-compatible** (newer versions of dbt can read manifests generated by older versions) but **not forward-compatible**.

Trying to read a manifest generated by a newer version (e.g., v1.8) using an older version of dbt (e.g., v1.7) will result in errors because the schema versions will not match.
