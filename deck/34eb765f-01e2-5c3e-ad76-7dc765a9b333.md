  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that tags are additive, meaning they combine across different configuration levels (project and model files), supporting the answer that both 'hourly' from dbt_project.yml and 'finance' from schema.yml are included in the tag list."

<front>

You define `tags: ['hourly']` in `dbt_project.yml` and `tags: ['finance']` in a model's schema.yml file. What is the resulting tag list for the model?

</front>

<back>

The resulting tags are `['hourly', 'finance']`.

Tags are an **additive** configuration. Instead of the more specific schema.yml tag replacing the project-level tag, dbt combines both lists.
