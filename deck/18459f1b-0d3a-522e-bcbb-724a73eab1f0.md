<front>

You need to apply a specific macro to a list of 20 distinct source tables. To keep the code DRY and easily configurable, where should you define this list and how should you pass it to the macro?

</front>

<back>

Define the list in `dbt_project.yml` under the `vars` configuration block. Then, pass the list to the macro using the `var()` function inside your model.

Example:
```sql
{{ my_macro(var('source_table_list')) }}
```
