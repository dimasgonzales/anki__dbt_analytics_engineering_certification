<front>

You have a model named `all_events` containing billions of rows that currently takes 4 hours to rebuild as a table every morning. How can you optimize the build time while keeping the data structure a table?

<back>

Configure the model as `incremental`. This will allow dbt to append only the new data arriving each day rather than dropping and recreating the entire table from scratch.

```sql
{{ config(materialized='incremental') }}
```

</back>
