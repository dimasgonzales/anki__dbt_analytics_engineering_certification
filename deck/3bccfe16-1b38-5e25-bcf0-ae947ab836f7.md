What is the primary difference between a Parsing (Syntax) error and a Binding (Semantic) error in SQL execution?

A **Parsing error** occurs when the SQL grammar is invalid (e.g., missing keywords, misplaced commas). A **Binding error** occurs when the syntax is valid, but the referenced objects do not exist or types are incompatible (e.g., applying a string function to an integer column).
