  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text describes parsing as enabling syntax validation and error handling, which aligns with parsing errors occurring due to invalid grammar. It also explains binding as resolving types and schema information, with a specific example of a function failing when incompatible types are used, directly supporting the definition of binding errors."
  citation:
    quote: "In the case of SQL binders, a major part of its job is to add *warehouse schema information,* like column *datatypes*, with the *type signatures* of warehouse operators described by the syntax tree to bring full *type awareness* to the syntax tree. It’s one thing to recognize a `substring` function in a query; it’s another to *understand* that a `substring` *must* operate on string data, and *always* produces string data, and will fail if you pass it an integer."

<front>

What is the primary difference between a Parsing (Syntax) error and a Binding (Semantic) error in SQL execution?

<back>

A **Parsing error** occurs when the SQL grammar is invalid (e.g., missing keywords, misplaced commas). A **Binding error** occurs when the syntax is valid, but the referenced objects do not exist or types are incompatible (e.g., applying a string function to an integer column).
