<front>

What does the `--store-failures` flag do when executing `dbt test`?

</front>

<back>

It causes dbt to materialize the results of failing tests into a table in the database (usually within a schema suffixed with `_dbt_test__audit`).

This allows you to query the specific records that caused the test failure for debugging purposes.
