  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that the `--store-failures` flag causes dbt to store test failures in a table, with the default schema suffix `_dbt_test__audit`, allowing for debugging by querying failed records."
  citation:
    quote: "The configured test(s) will store their failures when `dbt test --store-failures` is invoked. Failures are saved in a new table with the name of the test. By default, `store_failures` uses a schema named `{{ profile.schema }}_dbt_test__audit`."

What does the `--store-failures` flag do when executing `dbt test`?

<back>

It causes dbt to materialize the results of failing tests into a table in the database (usually within a schema suffixed with `_dbt_test__audit`).

This allows you to query the specific records that caused the test failure for debugging purposes.
