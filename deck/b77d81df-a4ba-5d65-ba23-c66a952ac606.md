<front>

You want to configure a CI job to run only modified models and their children to save costs, but these models depend on upstream tables that don't exist in the temporary CI schema. What command should you use?

<back>

Use `state:modified+` combined with `--defer` and `--state`.
```bash
dbt run -s state:modified+ --defer --state path/to/prod/artifacts
```
This tells dbt to build changed models and downstream dependencies while reading upstream definitions from the production state.
