<front>

A view model used by your BI tool is timing out during queries. The data volume is moderate, but the transformations are complex. How should you resolve this using materializations?

<back>

Change the materialization to `table`.
```yaml
{{ config(materialized='table') }}
```
While this increases build time, it physically stores the result, significantly speeding up query performance for end-users compared to computing the view on the fly.
