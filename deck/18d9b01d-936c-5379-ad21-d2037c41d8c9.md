  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text does not explicitly state that version 1 syntax is deprecated. It discusses the version key in dbt_project.yml being optional starting in dbt v1.5 and only supporting version 2 if specified, but there is no mention of deprecation for any version, including version 1. The text does not provide enough information to verify or contradict the claim."
