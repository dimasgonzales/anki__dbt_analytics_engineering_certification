<front>

A developer receives the following error: `Node model.marketing.kpis attempted to reference node model.finance.revenue, which is not allowed`. Both models are in the same project. What is the likely cause and how do you fix it?

</front>

<back>

The cause is that `model.finance.revenue` is configured with `access: private` and belongs to the 'finance' group, preventing the marketing model from referencing it.

To fix this, you must change the access level of the finance model to `protected` (to allow project-wide access) or move the marketing model into the finance group.
