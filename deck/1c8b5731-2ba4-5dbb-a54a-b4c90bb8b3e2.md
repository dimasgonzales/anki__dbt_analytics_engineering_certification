<front>

You have created a new model, `stg_orders.sql`. You want to reference this model in a downstream `fct_orders.sql` model. How should you write the FROM clause?

</front>

<back>

You must use the `ref()` function referencing the filename (without the extension).

Correct SQL:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM {{ ref('stg_orders') }}
```

Using raw table names (e.g., `FROM analytics.stg_orders`) is incorrect because dbt will not recognize the dependency or control the execution order.
