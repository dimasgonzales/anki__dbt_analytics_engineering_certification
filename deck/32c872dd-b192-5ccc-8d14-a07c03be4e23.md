<front>

A user installs your package but stores their raw data in a schema named `etl_production` instead of your package's default `raw_data`. How does the user configure the package to read from their correct schema?

</front>

<back>

The user adds a variable override in their root `dbt_project.yml` file matching the variable name used in your package's source definition.

Example:
```yaml
vars:
  package_name:
    raw_data_schema_variable: etl_production
```

</back>
