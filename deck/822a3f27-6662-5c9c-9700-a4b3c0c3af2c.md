<front>

You have a dbt model materialized as a dynamic table in Snowflake, but the query performance is poor on specific columns. How would you address this?

<back>

Add the `cluster_by` configuration to the model to physically organize the data based on the frequently filtered columns.
```sql
{{ config(
    materialized='dynamic_table',
    cluster_by=['event_date', 'region']
) }}
```

</back>
