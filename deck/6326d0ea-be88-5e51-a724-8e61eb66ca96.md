  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly mentions the 'stg_' prefix for staging models but does not provide any information on the prefixes for Intermediate or Marts layers, nor does it mention the use of these prefixes for features like Lenses. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to verify the full answer."

<front>

What are the standard naming prefixes for models in the Staging, Intermediate, and Marts layers according to dbt best practices?

</front>

<back>

*   **Staging**: `stg_`
*   **Intermediate**: `int_`
*   **Marts**: `fct_` (fact) or `dim_` (dimension)

Using these prefixes allows features like Lenses to categorize models automatically.
