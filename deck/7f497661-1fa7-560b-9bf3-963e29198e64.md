  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Answer correctly states that extra arguments like 'threshold' must be explicitly passed in YAML, with 'model' and 'column_name' implied. The Reference Text shows that arguments for tests can be specified in YAML by setting them as top-level properties under the test name, which aligns with the Answer's example."

    quote: "Older versions can set the <argument_name> as the top-level property."

<front>

You have defined a custom test that requires an extra argument named `threshold`:
```sql
{% test max_value(model, column_name, threshold) %} ...
```
How would you configure this in your YAML file?

<back>

You must explicitly pass the `threshold` argument in the YAML configuration. The `model` and `column_name` are implied.

```yaml
columns:
  - name: amount
    data_tests:
      - max_value:
          threshold: 1000
```

</back>
