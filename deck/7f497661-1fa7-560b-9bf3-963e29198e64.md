<front>

You have defined a custom test that requires an extra argument named `threshold`:
```sql
{% test max_value(model, column_name, threshold) %} ...
```
How would you configure this in your YAML file?

</front>

<back>

You must explicitly pass the `threshold` argument in the YAML configuration. The `model` and `column_name` are implied.

```yaml
columns:
  - name: amount
    data_tests:
      - max_value:
          threshold: 1000
```

</back>
