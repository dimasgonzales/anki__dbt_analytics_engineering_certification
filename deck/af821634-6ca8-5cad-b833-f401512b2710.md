<front>

You are developing `model_C`, which depends on `model_B` and `model_A`. You have not built A or B in your local schema. How would you run only `model_C` successfully using dbt CLI?

<back>

You would use the defer flag combined with a state reference:

```bash
dbt run --select model_C --defer --state path/to/prod_artifacts
```

This tells dbt to resolve the references for A and B using the production manifest and query them in the production schema, while building C in your local schema.
