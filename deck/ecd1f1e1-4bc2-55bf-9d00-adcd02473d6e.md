<front>

You added a new column to the SQL of an existing incremental model, but the column is missing from the warehouse table after a standard `dbt run`. How do you fix this?

Standard incremental runs often do not handle schema evolution (adding/removing columns) automatically. You must run the model with the `--full-refresh` flag to drop the old table structure and create the new one with the added column.
