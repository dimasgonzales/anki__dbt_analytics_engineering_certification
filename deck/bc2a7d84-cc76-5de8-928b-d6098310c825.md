<front>

A downstream model is failing because the `goal_amount` column from a Google Sheet source is being treated as a string `'$100'` instead of a number. Where and how should you resolve this?

</front>

<back>

Resolve this in the **Staging Model**. Use SQL casting to convert the field immediately when selecting from the source.

```sql
select
    cast(goal_amount as numeric) as goal_amount
from {{ source('google_sheets', 'goals') }}
```

</back>
