<front>

You want to ensure that your dbt production runs do not consume the same compute resources as your development runs in Materialize. How would you configure this in `profiles.yml`?

You should configure the `cluster` setting for each target to point to different clusters.

```yaml
outputs:
  prod:
    type: materialize
    cluster: prod_cluster
  dev:
    type: materialize
    cluster: dev_cluster
```
This provides workload isolation between environments.
