<front>

You need to ensure that every `customer_id` in your `orders` model exists in the `customers` table. How do you configure this test in YAML?

<back>

Use the **relationships** test. You must define the `to` argument (referencing the target parent model) and the `field` argument (the primary key column in that target model).

```yaml
columns:
  - name: customer_id
    data_tests:
      - relationships:
          to: ref('customers')
          field: id
```

</back>
