How can you specify a custom database, schema, or alias for a model or seed?

Using the `database`, `schema`, and `alias` configs.   
  
By default, all resources are built in the database (or "project" in BigQuery) specified by your profiles.yml file. The `database` config allows you to build some models/seeds in different databases if desired. Note that snapshots have a `target_database` config that serves the same basic purpose.   
  
  
  
By default, all resources are built in the schema specified in your target (i.e. the value of `{{ target.schema }}`. The `schema` config allows you to build some models/seeds in different schemas. Note that, by default, dbt will actually concatenate your custom schema name with the base schema name when actually creating the custom schema (i.e. `{{ target.schema }}_{{ schema }}`. For the reasoning behind this, see the links below:  
  
 .
  
  
By default, when creating a resource, dbt will use the name of the .sql file that defines the resource as the resource name (e.g. "sales.sql" gets built as a table called "sales"). The `alias` config allows you to specify a different name for dbt to use when creating and referencing the resource in question.
