<front>

You rename `models/marketing/customers.sql` to `models/marketing/vip_customers.sql` and execute `dbt run`. 

What is the resulting state of the data warehouse schemas?

</front>

<back>

Both the old `customers` object and the new `vip_customers` object will exist in the warehouse.

dbt creates the new model but does not automatically drop the old one. You must manually drop the old `customers` relation.
