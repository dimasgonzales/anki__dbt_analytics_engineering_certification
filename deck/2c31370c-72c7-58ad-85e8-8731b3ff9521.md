<front>

Given the following configuration, what will be the status of a source that was last loaded 14 hours ago?

```yaml
freshness:
  warn_after: {count: 12, period: hour}
  error_after: {count: 24, period: hour}
```

</front>

<back>

The status will be `warn`.

The data age (14 hours) exceeds the warning threshold (12 hours) but has not yet reached the error threshold (24 hours).
