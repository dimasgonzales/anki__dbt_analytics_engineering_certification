<front>

A model using a specific Snowflake dialect feature (`PIVOT ANY`) is failing dbt compilation with a syntax error, but the query runs successfully in the Snowflake console. How should you configure the model to allow it to run?

</front>

<back>

Disable static analysis for that specific model in `dbt_project.yml` or the config block. This bypasses the dbt parser's validation check.

```yaml
models:
  my_project:
    my_complex_model:
      +static_analysis: off
```

</back>
