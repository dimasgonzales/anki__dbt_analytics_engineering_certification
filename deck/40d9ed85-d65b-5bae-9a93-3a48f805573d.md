<front>

You have renamed the `id` column to `customer_id` in an existing seed file called `customers.csv`. How do you apply this change to the data warehouse?

<back>

You must use the full-refresh flag to force dbt to drop and recreate the table with the new schema:
```bash
dbt seed --full-refresh
```
Without this flag, dbt tries to insert into the old column structure.
