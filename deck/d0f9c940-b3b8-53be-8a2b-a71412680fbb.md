  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly demonstrates that the `+column_types` configuration key is used to map specific column names to SQL data types, such as `varchar`, which aligns with the answer's description of setting exact types rather than inferred ones for CREATE TABLE statements."

What is the purpose of the `+column_types` configuration key for seeds?

It allows you to map specific column names to SQL-valid data types (e.g., `varchar`, `text`, `integer`). This ensures the `CREATE TABLE` statement dbt generates uses the exact types you require rather than inferred ones.
