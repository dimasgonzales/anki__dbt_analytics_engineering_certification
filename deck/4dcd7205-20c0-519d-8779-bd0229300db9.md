  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly recommends staging models to be materialized as views and marts models as tables or incremental models, which directly supports the answer that staging defaults to views and marts to tables."

<front>

What are the recommended default materializations for **Staging** models versus **Marts** models in a standard dbt architecture?

</front>

<back>

Staging models should default to **views**, and Marts models should default to **tables**.

Staging models are intermediate building blocks generally not queried by end-users, while Marts require high performance for BI tools and analysis.
