<front>

You need a dataset that offers fast end-user query performance (sub-second) but the source data is massive, making a full rebuild take too long for your hourly SLA. Which materialization should you choose and why?

</front>

<back>

Choose `incremental`.

*   **Why not View:** Views calculate on read, resulting in slow end-user queries.
*   **Why not Table:** Full rebuilds are too slow for the hourly SLA.
*   **Why Incremental:** It provides the query speed of a physical table while minimizing build time by only processing the hourly delta.
