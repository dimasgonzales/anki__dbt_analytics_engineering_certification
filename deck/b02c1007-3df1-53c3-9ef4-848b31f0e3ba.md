<front>

Which specific characters require a YAML description string to be enclosed in quotes to avoid parsing errors?

</front>

<back>

Strings containing colons (`:`), curly brackets (`{}`), or square brackets (`[]`) must be quoted. These are special characters in YAML syntax.

Example:
```yaml
description: "Status: Active" # Required quotes due to colon
```

</back>
