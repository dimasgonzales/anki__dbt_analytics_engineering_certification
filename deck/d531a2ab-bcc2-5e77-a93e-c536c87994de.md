  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer correctly states that the primary property for dbt source freshness is `loaded_at_field`, which is required by default but optional on adapters that support warehouse metadata freshness checks. It also correctly mentions `loaded_at_query` as an alternative for custom SQL logic, which aligns with the reference text's description."

The primary property is `loaded_at_field`. It is required by default.

It is optional if the adapter supports pulling freshness from warehouse metadata tables.

The alternative is loaded_at_query for custom SQL logic.
