<front>

You have configured a model as `incremental`, but you notice that every run creates duplicate rows for existing orders instead of updating them. What configuration is likely missing?

</front>

<back>

You likely omitted the `unique_key` configuration. Without a `unique_key`, dbt's default behavior for incremental models is "append-only," meaning it simply adds all new rows to the table regardless of whether the business entity already exists.
```yaml
config(
  materialized='incremental',
  unique_key='order_id'
)
```

</back>
