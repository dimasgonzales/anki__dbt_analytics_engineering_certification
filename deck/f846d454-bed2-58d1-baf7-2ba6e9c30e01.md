  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer accurately describes storing and reusing node selector definitions using YAML selectors, including the file name 'selectors.yml', top-level key 'selectors:', required 'name' and 'definition', optional 'description' and 'default', and CLI invocation with '--selector', all explicitly supported by the reference text."
  citation:
    quote: "Selectors live in a top-level file named selectors.yml. Each must have a name and a definition, and can optionally define a description and default flag."

How can you store/reuse node selector definitions in your project repo?

Using **YAML Selectors**. Create a top-level file called `selectors.yml` in your repo. This file should have a top-level key of `selectors:`, mapped to a list of selector definitions. Each selector must have a `name` and `definition`, and can optionally have a `description` and `default` flag. The `definition` can be a simple CLI-style selector string, a set of key value pairs, or a full, rich YAML object.  
  
Selectors can be invoked in the CLI using the `--selector <name>` option.
