<front>

You are calling a macro that accepts a column name as an argument: `{{ clean_column(payment_method) }}`. The model fails to compile with an 'Undefined Error'. What is the likely cause?

</front>

<back>

You likely forgot to quote the argument.

Without quotes, Jinja interprets `payment_method` as a variable. Since that variable hasn't been defined in the Jinja context, it fails. You should pass it as a string:
```sql
{{ clean_column('payment_method') }}
```

</back>
