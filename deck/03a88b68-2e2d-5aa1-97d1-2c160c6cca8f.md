<front>

What **dbt\_project.yml** field is used to specify a custom list of directories from which files will be copied into the `target` directory as part of the `docs generate` command? What is the default? What is the use case for this functionality?

**asset-paths**. There is no default (i.e. by default, dbt will not compile any additional files as part of `docs generate`). The main use case is for including image files in your docs; images in your specified assets dir will be copied to your target dir and be accessible to import into your documentation.
