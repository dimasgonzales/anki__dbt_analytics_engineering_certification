  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly defines 'asset-paths' as the field for specifying directories to copy to the target during 'docs generate', confirms no default copying occurs, and states the use case is for rendering images in documentation."
  citation:
    quote: "Optionally specify a custom list of directories to copy to the `target` directory as part of the `docs generate` command. This is useful for rendering images in your repository in your project documentation. By default, dbt will not copy any additional files as part of docs generate."

What **dbt\_project.yml** field is used to specify a custom list of directories from which files will be copied into the `target` directory as part of the `docs generate` command? What is the default? What is the use case for this functionality?

**asset-paths**. There is no default (i.e. by default, dbt will not compile any additional files as part of `docs generate`). The main use case is for including image files in your docs; images in your specified assets dir will be copied to your target dir and be accessible to import into your documentation.
