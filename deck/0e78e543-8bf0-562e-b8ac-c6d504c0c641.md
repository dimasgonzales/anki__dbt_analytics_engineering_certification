What are the four most common error types you will encounter using dbt and what do they generally signify?

- **Runtime Errors** generally occur in the **initialization** step of a dbt run. These indicate a fundamental inability to start up the execution (e.g. directory is not a dbt project, profile.yml doesn't exist, db connection failed, etc.)
- **Compilation Errors** generally occur in the **parsing** step. These indicate errors in your YAML or Jinja code, as well as invalid resource references (e.g. bad "ref" calls)
- **Dependency Errors** generally occur in the **graph validation** step. These indicate you have a cycle in your DAG (making it not a D**A**G anymore...).
- **Database Errors** generally occur in the **SQL execution** step. These errors come from your data warehouse, and dbt just passes the message on. These almost always mean you have a SQL error. It can be helpful to try running the offending compiled SQL in isolation to identify and fix the problem.
