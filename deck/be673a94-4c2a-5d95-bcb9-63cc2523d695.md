In dbt, should you prioritize the formatting of the compiled SQL or the readability of the source code? Why?

Prioritize the **readability of the source code**. 

Debugging and development happen in the source files. While Jinja whitespace control exists, dbt compiles the SQL effectively regardless of whitespace, so 'pretty' compiled SQL is rarely worth the trade-off of messy source code.
