  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that selecting 'Rollback to remote' resets the repository to match the remote state and causes uncommitted changes to be lost, which directly supports the answer that uncommitted local changes are discarded and the workspace is hard-reset."
  citation:
    quote: "Rollback to remote resets your repo back to an earlier clone from your remote. Any saved but uncommitted changes will be lost, so make sure you copy any modified code that you want to keep in a temporary location outside of dbt."

<back>

All uncommitted local changes are permanently discarded. The local workspace is hard-reset to match the state of the code as it exists on the remote git server.
