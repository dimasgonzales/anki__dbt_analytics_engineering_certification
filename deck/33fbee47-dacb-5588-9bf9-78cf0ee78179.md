<front>

You represent a versioned model where `v2` introduces new logic involving a column that does not exist in `v1`. How should you configure the unit test to check this logic without causing errors on `v1`?

</front>

<back>

Configure the unit test to explicitly include only version 2.

Example:
```yaml
unit_tests:
  - name: test_new_logic
    model: my_model
    versions:
      include:
        - 2
```

</back>
