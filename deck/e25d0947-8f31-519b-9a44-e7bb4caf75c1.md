<front>

You placed a file named `marketing_goals.csv` in a new folder named `static_data`, but running `dbt seed` returns "No seeds found". What is the likely cause?

<back>

The `static_data` directory is likely not included in the `seed-paths` configuration in your `dbt_project.yml` file. dbt only scans directories explicitly defined in this configuration to find seed targets.
