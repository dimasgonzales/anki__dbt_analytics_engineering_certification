<front>

A source table was updated 10 minutes ago, but `dbt source freshness` fails stating the data is 5 hours old. What is the most likely cause?

<back>

A timezone mismatch between the dbt runner and the data warehouse.

Since dbt calculates freshness in Python, if the warehouse returns a timestamp in UTC but the runner interprets it as Local Time (or vice-versa) without proper offsets, the calculated gap will be incorrect.
