<front>

You define a `primary_key` constraint on the `customer_id` column in a Snowflake model contract. If the source data contains duplicate `customer_id` values, will the model build fail?

<back>

No, the build will succeed. Snowflake (and BigQuery/Redshift) does not enforce primary keys at the database level. To catch duplicates, you must still include a standard dbt `unique` test, which runs after the table is built.
