  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly states that write commands are limited to one invocation at a time and cannot run in parallel with other write commands, but can run alongside read commands, which directly supports the Answer."

<back>

dbt limits 'Write' commands (commands that modify data or metadata) to **one invocation at a time**. They cannot run in parallel with other 'Write' commands to ensure data integrity, though they can run alongside 'Read' commands.
