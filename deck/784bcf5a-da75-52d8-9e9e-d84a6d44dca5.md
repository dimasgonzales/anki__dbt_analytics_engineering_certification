<front>

You are running `dbt run --select dim_orders`. Inside a hook, you want to conditionally perform an action if this model is included. How should you format the check in Jinja?

<back>

You must check for the fully qualified Node ID, not just the model name.

```jinja
{% if 'model.my_project.dim_orders' in selected_resources %}
  -- Action here
{% endif %}
```
