<front>

You have updated a macro file, but when running your models, dbt appears to be using the old logic. How would you troubleshoot this to ensure the latest changes are picked up?

Run your command with the `--no-partial-parse` flag. 

Sometimes dbt's internal state cache may desync from the file system; forcing a full re-parse ensures the manifest is rebuilt from scratch using the current file contents.

```bash
dbt run --no-partial-parse
```
