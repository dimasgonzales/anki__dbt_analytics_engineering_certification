<front>

During a `dbt build`, a Unit Test for `model_x` fails. Will dbt attempt to create the table for `model_x` in the warehouse?

<back>

No. If a unit test fails, dbt blocks the materialization of the model.

This saves compute costs by preventing the execution of the actual SQL transformation against the warehouse when logic errors are detected.
