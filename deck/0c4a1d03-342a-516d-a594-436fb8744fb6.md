<front>

You have configured a macro in `dbt_project.yml` under `on-run-start` to grant permissions by iterating over the `schemas` variable. What will happen when you execute `dbt run`?

</front>

<back>

The macro will likely fail or do nothing because the `schemas` variable evaluates to `none` during `on-run-start`. The list of schemas modified by the run is only populated and available during the `on-run-end` context.
