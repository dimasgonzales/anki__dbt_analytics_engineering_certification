<front>

What is the state of the Jinja variable `execute` during the `dbt compile` command vs. the parsing phase?

<back>

During the parsing phase, `execute` is `False`. During `dbt compile` (and `dbt run`), `execute` is set to `True`. This distinction allows developers to prevent expensive operations, like database queries, from running during project parsing.
