  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly states that the `execute` variable is set to `True` during `dbt compile` and `dbt run`, supporting part of the answer. However, it does not contain any information about the state of `execute` during the parsing phase, which is the other part of the answer. Therefore, the full answer cannot be fully verified based on the provided text."
  citation:
    quote: "\"` and `dbt run` are similar because they both require a data platform connection, run queries, and have an [`execute` variable](/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/execute) set to `True`.\""

<front>

What is the state of the Jinja variable `execute` during the `dbt compile` command vs. the parsing phase?

<back>

During the parsing phase, `execute` is `False`. During `dbt compile` (and `dbt run`), `execute` is set to `True`. This distinction allows developers to prevent expensive operations, like database queries, from running during project parsing.
