<front>

You change a model's configuration from `materialized='view'` to `materialized='table'`. When you run `dbt run`, it fails because the database cannot atomically replace a view with a table.

How do you resolve this?

Run the model with the full refresh flag:

```bash
dbt run --select <model_name> --full-refresh
```

This tells dbt to drop the existing view object before attempting to create the new table.
