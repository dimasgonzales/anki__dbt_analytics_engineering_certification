<front>

You added a new column to your incremental model's SQL, but after running `dbt run`, the column is missing from the table. How would you troubleshoot and fix this via configuration?

<back>

The model is likely using the default `ignore` behavior. You should configure `on_schema_change` to `append_new_columns` or `sync_all_columns` to force dbt to update the table structure.

Code Example:
```sql
{{ config(on_schema_change='sync_all_columns') }}
```
