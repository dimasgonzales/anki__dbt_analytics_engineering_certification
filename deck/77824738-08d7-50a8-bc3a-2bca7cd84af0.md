<front>

You have a 500MB CSV file of raw historical event logs and a 50KB CSV file containing marketing channel categories. Which one should be implemented as a dbt seed?

Only the **marketing channel categories**. 

The historical logs are too large and transactional; they should be loaded via an ELT tool and defined as a `source`. Seeds are best suited for small, static reference datasets.
