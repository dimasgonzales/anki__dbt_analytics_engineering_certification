<front>

You want to use `dbt_utils.expression_is_true` to validate `total = subtotal + tax`. Given the YAML structure below, is this correct?

```yaml
models:
  - name: orders
    columns:
      - name: total
        data_tests:
          - dbt_utils.expression_is_true ...
```

</front>

<back>

No, this is incorrect. Tests involving logic across multiple columns (total, subtotal, tax) should be placed at the **model level**, not nested under a specific column like `total`.
