<front>

Your dbt project has many independent models that could run in parallel, but the run is slow because models are waiting in a queue. How do you fix this?

<back>

Increase the `threads` value in your `profiles.yml` file for the active target. This allocates more connection slots to build more models simultaneously.
```yaml
dev:
  type: snowflake
  threads: 8
```
