  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly confirms that macros should be documented using a schema file (such as a .yml file) with configurations under a `macros:` key, and examples show including a description and an `arguments:` list for parameters, which aligns with the Answer."

<front>

You have created a custom macro and need to document its parameters so other developers know how to use it. How do you configure this in YAML?

<back>

Add the macro to a `.yml` file under a `macros:` block. Provide a description for the macro itself, and define an `arguments:` list to document specific parameters.

```yaml
macros:
  - name: calculate_tax
    description: "Calculates tax based on region"
    arguments:
      - name: region_code
        description: "The ISO region code"
```

</back>
