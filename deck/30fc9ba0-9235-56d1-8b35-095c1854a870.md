<front>

You are attempting to run `dbt seed` for a raw file named `raw_exports.csv` that uses pipes (`|`) as separators. The command runs but the data is loaded into a single column instead of being parsed correctly. How would you fix this?

Configure the `delimiter` specifically for that seed to use the pipe character.

In `dbt_project.yml`:
```yaml
seeds:
  my_project:
    raw_exports:
      +delimiter: "|"
```

</back>
