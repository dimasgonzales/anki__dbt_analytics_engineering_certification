<front>

You are debugging why a CI run failed to identify a modified model. You suspect the comparison state is incorrect. Which file in the artifacts directory should you inspect to see the *previous* state's project structure?

</front>

<back>

You should inspect the **`manifest.json`** provided to the `--state` path.

dbt compares the *current* parsed project against the *artifacts'* `manifest.json` to determine what qualifies as `state:modified`.
