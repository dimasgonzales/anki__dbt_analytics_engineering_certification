<front>

You have a model `orders_aggregated` materialized as a `table` that takes over 2 hours to build because the source data is massive. However, BI users need this data updated daily. How should you optimize the materialization?

<back>

Switch to `incremental` materialization. This strategy improves build speed by only transforming and appending new or changed records, rather than rebuilding the entire table from scratch on every run. 

Example config:
```yaml
{{ config(materialized='incremental') }}
```
