  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that the + prefix is used for configurations only in dbt_project.yml, which matches the answer's description."

<front>

When configuring model properties in `dbt_project.yml`, what is the purpose of the `+` prefix on keys?

</front>

<back>

The `+` prefix indicates that the key is a **configuration** (like `+materialized` or `+tags`) rather than a subdirectory name. This distinction helps dbt parse the file correctly to apply settings to the appropriate scope.
Example:
```yaml
models:
  marketing:
    +materialized: view
```
