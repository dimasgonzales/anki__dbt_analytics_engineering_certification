  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly states that dbt truncates to avoid a drop cascade command that would drop downstream objects, directly supporting the Answer's claim about preserving dependencies and preventing disruption."

<front>

Why does dbt default to using a TRUNCATE strategy rather than DROP when updating existing seeds?

<back>

dbt defaults to `TRUNCATE` to preserve downstream dependencies. Dropping a table often requires a `CASCADE` operation, which would delete any views or tables that reference the seed, breaking the DAG and potentially disrupting BI dashboards.
