<front>

You have a project named `jaffle_shop`. You want all snapshots in the `models/snapshots/marketing` directory to use the `timestamp` strategy without defining it in every individual file. How do you configure this in `dbt_project.yml`?

<back>

Configure the hierarchy under `snapshots` -> `jaffle_shop` -> `marketing`. Use the `+strategy` key to apply the setting to that specific path.
```yaml
snapshots:
  jaffle_shop:
    marketing:
      +strategy: timestamp
      +updated_at: last_modified
```

</back>
