<front>

You are troubleshooting lineage in dbt Explorer and notice that `model_staging` (which feeds `model_public`) is missing from the graph, even though you can see it in the dbt Cloud IDE. What is the reason for this discrepancy?

<back>

This is expected behavior in a Mesh setup. `model_staging` is an 'indirect' dependency. dbt Explorer filters these out to focus on the public interface between projects, whereas the IDE shows the complete lineage required for development and execution.
