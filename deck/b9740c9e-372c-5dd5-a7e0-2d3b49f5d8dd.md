  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that the dbt build command runs models, tests tests, snapshots snapshots, seeds seeds, operates in DAG order for selected resources or entire project, and writes a single manifest and run results artifact. However, details on specific selection syntax and flags are not found in the provided text, but the key claims are supported."

What does the `dbt build` command do?

<back>

The `dbt build` command will:

- run models
- test tests
- snapshot snapshots
- seed seeds

In DAG order, for selected resources or an entire project.

You can build a subset of resources using standard selection syntax, plus `--resource-type` flag that offers a final filter layer (e.g. restrict build to just snapshots). In general, the build task supports the same flags as run, test, snapshot, and seed.

The build task will also write a single manifest file and a single run results artifact, which contains the run results for all models, tests, seeds, etc., combined into one file.
