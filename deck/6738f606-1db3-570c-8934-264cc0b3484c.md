<front>

Which directories should generally be included in a dbt project's `.gitignore` file to prevent version control bloat?

<back>

You should exclude directories that contain generated artifacts or dependencies. The standard exclusions are:
- `target/` (compiled SQL and run artifacts)
- `dbt_packages/` (installed external packages)
- `logs/` (execution logs)
