<front>

A specific `dbt seed` command is failing with a 'Query too large' error on your data platform. How can you resolve this without modifying the CSV file?

<back>

Override the `get_batch_size` macro for your specific adapter to return a smaller number. This forces dbt to break the seed operation into smaller SQL statements.

```sql
{% macro trino__get_batch_size() %}
  {{ return(100) }}
{% endmacro %}
```

</back>
