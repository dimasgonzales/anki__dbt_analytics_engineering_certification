<front>

You have a large incremental model using the `merge` strategy that performs a full table scan on the destination table during updates, causing slow runs. How can you optimize this without changing the materialization type?

<back>

Configure `incremental_predicates` in the model config to limit the data scanned in the destination table based on a key (like time). For example:
```sql
{{ config(
  incremental_predicates = ["dbt_internal_target.created_at >= current_date - 7"]
) }}
```
