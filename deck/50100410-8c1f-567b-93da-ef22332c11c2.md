  explanation: "The Reference Text only confirms that configurations can be defined in `dbt_project.yml`, but does not mention `.yml` property files or the `config()` macro, nor does it specify that database-specific settings like Redshift sort/dist keys must be defined using the `config()` macro. Insufficient evidence to fully support or contradict the answer."

<front>

What are the three locations where dbt model configurations can be defined, and which method is required for database-specific settings like Redshift `sort` or `dist` keys?

<back>

Configurations can be defined in `dbt_project.yml`, a `.yml` property file, or within the model using the `config()` macro. Database-specific settings like sort/dist keys (or partitioning) must be defined using the `config()` macro inside the model file.
