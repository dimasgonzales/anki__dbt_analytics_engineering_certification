<front>

By default, dbt writes logs to two distinct locations. What are they, and how does their content differ?

<back>

dbt writes to:
1. **stdout (Terminal):** Human-readable, interactive feedback.
2. **`logs/dbt.log`:** Detailed, machine-readable information.

The `dbt.log` file includes all events (including `DEBUG` level) and full error traces that are often suppressed or truncated in the terminal output.
