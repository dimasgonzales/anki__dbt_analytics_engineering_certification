  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that dbt writes logs to two locations: stdout for interactive feedback and logs/dbt.log for detailed debugging, including all DEBUG-level events and contextual information, which directly supports the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "As dbt runs, it generates events. The most common way to see those events is as log messages, written in real time to two places: The command line terminal (stdout), to provide interactive feedback while running dbt. The debug log file (logs/dbt.log), to enable detailed debugging of errors when they occur. The text-formatted log messages in this file include all DEBUG-level events, as well as contextual information, such as log level and thread name."

<front>

By default, dbt writes logs to two distinct locations. What are they, and how does their content differ?

<back>

dbt writes to:
1. **stdout (Terminal):** Human-readable, interactive feedback.
2. **`logs/dbt.log`:** Detailed, machine-readable information.

The `dbt.log` file includes all events (including `DEBUG` level) and full error traces that are often suppressed or truncated in the terminal output.
