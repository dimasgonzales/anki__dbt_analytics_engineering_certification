<front>

You are defining version 2 of a model which has the exact same columns as the base model, except one column ('old_status') is removed. How can you configure this in YAML without re-typing every column?

</front>

<back>

Use `include: all` combined with the `exclude` list within the columns configuration for that specific version.

Example:
```yaml
versions:
  - v: 2
    columns:
      - include: all
        exclude: [old_status]
```

</back>
