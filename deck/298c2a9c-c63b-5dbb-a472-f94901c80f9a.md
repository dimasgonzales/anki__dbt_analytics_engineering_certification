<front>

You notice that a downstream model is missing from the Lineage Graph relative to its parent `stg_orders`, even though the SQL query runs successfully in the warehouse. What is the most likely cause?

<back>

The downstream model is likely using a hardcoded table name (e.g., `FROM analytics.stg_orders`) instead of the `{{ ref('stg_orders') }}` function. dbt builds the DAG and lineage based exclusively on Jinja references, not raw SQL table names.
