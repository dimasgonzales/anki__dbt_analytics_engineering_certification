  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that the dbt Cloud CLI stores its configuration in 'dbt_cloud.yml' within the '.dbt' directory, and states that a 'profiles.yml' file is not needed, aligning with the answer's claims about file location and non-reliance on 'profiles.yml'."

Where does the dbt Cloud CLI store authentication context and active project settings, and where is this file located?

It stores these settings in `dbt_cloud.yml`, located in the `~/.dbt/` directory. Unlike dbt Core, the Cloud CLI does not rely primarily on `profiles.yml` for connection details, as these are managed via the dbt Cloud platform integration.
