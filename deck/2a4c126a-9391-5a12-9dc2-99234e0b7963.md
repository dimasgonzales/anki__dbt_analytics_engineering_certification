  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that the `column_types` configuration is used to set datatypes explicitly for seed columns, which overrides dbt's automatic data type inference, matching the core claim in the answer."

<front>

Which configuration key allows you to override dbt's automatic data type inference for seed columns?

</front>

<back>

The `column_types` configuration (often used with the `+` prefix in `dbt_project.yml`). 

This allows you to explicitly define types like `varchar` or `date` instead of relying on dbt guessing based on CSV content.
