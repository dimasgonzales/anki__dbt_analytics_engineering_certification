  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that the results of the dbt source freshness command are written to a JSON file named sources.json in the target/ directory, which directly supports the answer's first statement. The text does not mention storage in the data warehouse, but this does not contradict the answer, and the core location claim is verified."
  citation:
    quote: "Additionally, dbt will write the freshness results to a file in the `target/` directory called `sources.json` by default."

<front>

Where are the results of a `dbt source freshness` command stored?

<back>

The results are written to a JSON artifact file named `sources.json` located in the `target/` directory of your project. They are not automatically stored in your data warehouse.
