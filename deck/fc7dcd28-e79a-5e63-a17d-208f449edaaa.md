<front>

You are configuring a private package dependency that requires a git token via `{{ env_var('GIT_TOKEN') }}`. You place this in `dependencies.yml` and it fails. Why?

<back>

The `dependencies.yml` file resolves contents as static text and ignores Jinja templating. The token function is being read literally rather than executed. You must move this configuration to `packages.yml` to support the `env_var` function.
