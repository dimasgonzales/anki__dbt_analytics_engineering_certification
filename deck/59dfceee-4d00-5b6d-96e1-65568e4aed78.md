  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer correctly states that ref() references models to establish dependencies and avoid hardcoding, which is explicitly supported by the reference text describing it as inferring dependencies for correct build order and recommending its use over direct references."
  citation:
    quote: "Using the ref function allows dbt to infer dependencies, ensuring that models are built in the correct order. It also ensures that your current model selects from upstream tables and views in the same environment that you're working in. Always use the ref function when selecting from another model, rather than using the direct relation reference."

<front>

What is the primary function of `{{ ref() }}` in dbt models?

<back>

It references other models to establish dependencies and build the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

Using `ref()` allows dbt to determine the correct execution order and ensures you are not hardcoding table names.
