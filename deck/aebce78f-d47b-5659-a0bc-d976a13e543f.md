How do you define a custom materialization in dbt, and how does dbt determine which implementation to use?

<back>

You define materializations using the `{% materialization name, adapter %}` block. dbt uses **multiple dispatch** to determine which implementation to use: it looks for an implementation specific to the current adapter (e.g., `adapter='snowflake'`). If none is found, it falls back to the implementation defined with `default`.
