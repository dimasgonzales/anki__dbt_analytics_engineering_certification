  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer correctly identifies 'clean-targets' as the field, matches the default behavior of removing files in target-path when not configured, and aligns with the use case of including directories like log-path and packages-install-path, as evidenced in the reference text."
  citation:
    quote: "Definition: Optionally specify a custom list of directories to be removed by the `dbt clean` [command](/reference/commands/clean). As such, you should only include directories containing artifacts (e.g. compiled files, logs, installed packages) in this list. Default: If this configuration is not included in your `dbt_project.yml` file, the `clean` command will remove files in your [target-path](/reference/global-configs/json-artifacts)."

What **dbt\_project.yml** field is used to specify a custom list of directories to be removed by the `dbt clean` command? What is the default? What is the use case?

**clean-targets**. By default, `dbt clean` will remove files in your `target-path`. The main use case (recommended by dbtlabs) is to "upgrade" `dbt clean` to also remove installed packages and logs, by adding the values of your `log-path` and `packages-install-path` to the `clean-targets` list.
