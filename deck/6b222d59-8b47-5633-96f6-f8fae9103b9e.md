Your Python model performs a heavy machine learning training job and fails after 5 minutes due to a platform limit. How do you extend the allowed execution time for just this model?

<back>

Configure the `timeout` parameter specifically for that model using `dbt.config()` within the file or in the `dbt_project.yml`. The value is typically defined in seconds.

```python
# Sets timeout to 20 minutes
dbt.config(timeout=1200)
```
