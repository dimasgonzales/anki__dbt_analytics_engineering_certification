<front>

When running `dbt clone`, what flag is required to force the command to overwrite existing objects in the target schema?

</front>

<back>

The **`--full-refresh`** flag.

By default, `dbt clone` may fail or skip if it detects existing relations in the target schema. Adding `--full-refresh` ensures the existing objects are dropped and replaced by the new clones.
