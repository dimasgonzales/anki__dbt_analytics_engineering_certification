  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text from the jinja-macros source explicitly describes the debug macro as opening an iPython debugger, which aligns with the answer's claim that it acts as a breakpoint and opens an interactive ipdb session."

<front>

What is the primary function of the `{{ debug() }}` macro within a dbt project?

<back>

It acts as a breakpoint in your Jinja code. When dbt encounters it, it pauses compilation or execution and opens an interactive **ipdb** (iPython debugger) session, allowing you to inspect variables and the current context.
