<front>

You are configuring a source `marketing` that contains 20 tables. All 20 tables use the column `_etl_loaded_at` to track data latency. How can you configure freshness without writing the field name 20 times?

<back>

Define `loaded_at_field` at the source level rather than the table level.

```yaml
sources:
  - name: marketing
    loaded_at_field: _etl_loaded_at
    tables:
      - name: campaigns
      - name: clicks
```

</back>
