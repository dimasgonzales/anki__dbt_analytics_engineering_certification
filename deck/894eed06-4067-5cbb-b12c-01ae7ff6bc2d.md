<front>

You want your generated dbt documentation to provide a direct link to a Looker dashboard so stakeholders can access it immediately. How do you configure this?

<back>

You must configure the `url` property within the exposure definition.

```yaml
exposures:
  - name: weekly_sales
    type: dashboard
    url: https://looker.com/dashboards/123
```
This renders a clickable button or link in the dbt documentation site.
