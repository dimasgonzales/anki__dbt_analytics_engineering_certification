<front>

You execute the command `dbt docs generate --select +finance_dashboard`. Will models outside of this selection appear in the documentation lineage graph?

Yes. Because `dbt docs generate` compiles the full project regardless of selection, the Lineage Graph will show all models. However, database statistics (like row counts and column types) will only be populated for `finance_dashboard` and its upstream dependencies.
