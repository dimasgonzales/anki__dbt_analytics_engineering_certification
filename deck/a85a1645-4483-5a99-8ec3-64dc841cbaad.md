<front>

You have a model file named `Monthly_Revenue.sql`. You defined tests in `schema.yml` for `name: monthly_revenue`, but dbt does not run them. What is the likely cause?

<back>

The names do not match due to **case sensitivity**.

`Monthly_Revenue` (filename) is not equal to `monthly_revenue` (YAML). To fix this, either rename the file to lowercase (recommended) or update the YAML name to match the filename exactly.
