<front>

You have an external ML model that consumes `fct_churn_prediction`. You want to run a job that builds this model and all its upstream dependencies using dbt selector syntax. How would you execute this?

</front>

<back>

Use the `+` prefix combined with the `exposure:` selection method in the CLI. This selects the exposure and all its upstream parents defined in the `depends_on` property.

```bash
dbt run --select +exposure:churn_prediction_model
```

</back>
