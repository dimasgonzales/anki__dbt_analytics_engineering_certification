  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text confirms that 'dbt source freshness' queries source tables and exits with a non-zero code if stale, but does not mention the 'sources.json' file placement in the target directory or the use of dbt selection syntax for filtering, which are included in the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "If your dbt project is configured with sources, then the `dbt source freshness` command will query all of your defined source tables, determining the 'freshness' of these tables. If the tables are stale (based on the `freshness` config specified for your sources) then dbt will report a warning or error accordingly. If a source table is in a stale state, then dbt will exit with a nonzero exit code."

What does the `dbt source freshness` command do?

</front>

---

<back>

This command queries all of your project's defined source tables and determines the "freshness" of those tables, based on the freshness configuration for each source (e.g. what timestamp column indicates data changes, how old does data need to be to trigger a warning or error, etc). If a source table is found to be "stale", dbt will exit with a non-zero error code. When the command completes, a freshness summary file will be placed in your target directory called `sources.json`.
  
  
As with most other commands, the sources checked can be filtered using dbt selection syntax.
