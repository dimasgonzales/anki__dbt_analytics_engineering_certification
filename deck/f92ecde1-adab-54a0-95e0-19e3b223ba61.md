  explanation: "The reference text supports both claims in the answer. For materialization, it mentions setting materializations at the folder level and overriding them with individual model configs, which aligns with defining in dbt_project.yml or model files. For description, it shows examples of descriptions in YAML files without mentioning dbt_project.yml, supporting that descriptions are defined in .yml property files."

<front>

You want to add a description to a model and set its materialization to 'table'. Where should you define each of these attributes?

1. **Materialization (Config):** Can be defined in `dbt_project.yml` (using `+materialized`) or within the model file (using `{{ config() }}`).
2. **Description (Property):** Must be defined in a `.yml` property file (e.g., `schema.yml`) under the `models:` block.

Descriptions *cannot* be defined in `dbt_project.yml`.
