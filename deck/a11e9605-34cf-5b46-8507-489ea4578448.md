What is the structural difference between the `schemas` and `database_schemas` context variables in dbt?

<back>

`schemas` is a list of strings representing only the schema names (e.g., `['finance', 'marketing']`).

`database_schemas` is a list of tuples containing both the database and schema (e.g., `[('analytics', 'finance'), ('raw', 'marketing')]`), used for multi-database contexts.
