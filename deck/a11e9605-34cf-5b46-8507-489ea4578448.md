  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer correctly states that `schemas` is a list of strings for schema names and `database_schemas` is a list of tuples for database-schema pairs, used in multi-database contexts. The reference text explicitly describes both variables and provides macro examples that match these structures."
  citation:
    quote: "The `schemas` context variable can be used to reference the schemas that dbt has built models into during a run of dbt. The `database_schemas` context variable can be used to reference the databases *and* schemas that dbt has built models into during a run of dbt. This variable is similar to the `schemas` variable, and should be used if a dbt run builds resources into multiple different databases."

What is the structural difference between the `schemas` and `database_schemas` context variables in dbt?

<back>

`schemas` is a list of strings representing only the schema names (e.g., `['finance', 'marketing']`).

`database_schemas` is a list of tuples containing both the database and schema (e.g., `[('analytics', 'finance'), ('raw', 'marketing')]`), used for multi-database contexts.
