  explanation: "The reference text mentions a 'Sources JSON file' generated by source freshness with specific keys like elapsed_time and results including max_loaded_at, which partially aligns with the answer. However, it does not explicitly confirm the exact filename as 'sources.json', the generation in the 'target/' directory, or the inclusion of 'pass/fail status' in the metadata."
  citation:
    quote: "Sources JSON file  **Produced by:** [`source freshness`](/reference/commands/source)  This file contains information about [sources with freshness checks](/docs/build/sources#checking-source-freshness).  ### Top-level keys[​](#top-level-keys \"Direct link to Top-level keys\")  * `elapsed_time`: Total invocation time in seconds. * `results`: Array of freshness-check execution details.  Each entry in `results` is a dictionary with the following keys:  * `unique_id`: Unique source node identifier, which map results to `sources` in the [manifest](/reference/artifacts/manifest-json) * `max_loaded_at`: Max value of `loaded_at_field` timestamp in the source table when queried. * `snapshotted_at`: Current timestamp when querying."

Which artifact file does dbt generate after running a freshness check, and what information does it contain?

<back>

`sources.json`. It is generated in the `target/` directory and contains metadata about the freshness execution, including pass/fail status, max loaded timestamps, and calculation times for every source checked.
