<front>

You have defined a `not_null` constraint on a column in a model materialized as a `view`. During a `dbt run`, null values are processed without triggering an error. What is the likely cause?

</front>

<back>

Constraints are not applied to views. Even with `contract: {enforced: true}`, constraints are effectively ignored by the database unless the materialization is `table` or `incremental`. You should use a standard data test or change the materialization.
