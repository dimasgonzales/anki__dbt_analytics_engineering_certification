  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that the `print()` function is used to print messages to the log file and stdout, which directly supports the answer's description of its primary purpose for outputting messages. However, the additional detail about it being primarily used within macros for debugging purposes is not mentioned in the provided text, but it does not contradict the verified core functionality."

What is the primary purpose of the `print()` function in dbt Jinja contexts?

<back>

The `print()` function is used to output messages to both standard output (stdout) and the dbt log file. It is primarily used within macros for debugging purposes to inspect variable values or trace execution flow.

Example:
```jinja
{{ print('Variable value: ' ~ my_var) }}
```
