  explanation: "The answer accurately lists the three conditions specified in the reference text for the is_incremental() macro to return true."
  citation:
    quote: "The `is_incremental()` macro powers incremental materializations. It will return `True` if *all* of the following conditions are met: * The model must already exist as a table in the database * The `full-refresh` flag *is not* passed * The running model is configured with `materialized='incremental'`"
