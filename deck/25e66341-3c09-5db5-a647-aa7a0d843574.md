<front>

You have a `not_null` test that frequently fails with 1-2 rows due to known data lag, causing the production pipeline to stop. You want to be alerted to these small failures but only stop the pipeline if failures exceed 50 rows. How do you configure this?

</front>

<back>

Configure the test with both `warn_if` (to alert on any failure) and `error_if` (to stop the pipeline only on major failures).

```yaml
config:
  warn_if: "> 0"
  error_if: "> 50"
```

</back>
