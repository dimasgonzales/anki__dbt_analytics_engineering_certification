  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly confirms that in dbt Python models, all Python code is executed remotely on the data platform and not locally by dbt, which directly supports the Answer's claim about the server-side Python model runtime. While the text does not explicitly detail the dbt CLI environment or the independence of Python versions, it does not contradict these aspects, and the core difference regarding execution location is validated."

What is the difference between the Python environment used to execute the dbt CLI and the Python runtime used for dbt Python models?

<back>

The dbt CLI environment runs locally (client-side) or on an orchestrator to parse projects and compile code. The Python model runtime executes server-side on the data platform (e.g., Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery). These environments are independent and can use different Python versions.
