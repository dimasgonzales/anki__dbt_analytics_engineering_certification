What is the difference between the Python environment used to execute the dbt CLI and the Python runtime used for dbt Python models?

<back>

The dbt CLI environment runs locally (client-side) or on an orchestrator to parse projects and compile code. The Python model runtime executes server-side on the data platform (e.g., Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery). These environments are independent and can use different Python versions.
