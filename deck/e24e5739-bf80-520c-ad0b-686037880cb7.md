<front>

You are modeling a massive fact table in Redshift that does not have a single dominant join key, and you are concerned about data skew (one node holding too much data). Which distribution style should you apply?

You should apply `dist='even'`. This uses round-robin distribution to write data to nodes in equal order, effectively preventing data skew when there isn't a clear candidate for key-based distribution.
