<front>

You need to create a model that trains a linear regression model using BigFrames and materializes the results as a table. How would you structure the file in dbt?

</front>

<back>

Create a `.py` file in your models directory. Define a function named `model` taking `dbt` and `session` as arguments. Configure the materialization and return the final DataFrame.

```python
def model(dbt, session):
    dbt.config(materialized='table')
    # ML logic here
    return final_df
```

</back>
