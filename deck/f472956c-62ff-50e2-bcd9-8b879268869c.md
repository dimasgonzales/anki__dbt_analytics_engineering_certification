  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer correctly specifies using the `ref()` function with the seed file name excluding the extension to reference a seed in a downstream model, which is explicitly supported by the reference text that states to use the `ref` function for this purpose and provides an example."

How do you reference a seed in a downstream model to ensure it is part of the dbt DAG?

Use the `ref()` function with the name of the seed file (excluding the extension).
```sql
select * from {{ ref('my_seed_file') }}
```
Do not query the raw table name directly.
