  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text confirms that during a SQL syntax error in dbt run, the compiled SQL is stored in the target/run/ directory and can be opened and executed manually to pinpoint the error, which aligns with the flashcard answer."
  citation:
    quote: "Also open the compiled SQL (in this case `target/run/jaffle_shop/models/customers.sql` as per the error message) — it can be useful to show these side-by-side in your code editor. Copy and paste the compiled query into a query runner (e.g. the Snowflake UI, or a desktop app like DataGrip / TablePlus) and execute it."

<front>

Your model is failing with a generic SQL syntax error during `dbt run`. How can you view the exact query dbt tried to execute to troubleshoot the syntax manually?

<back>

Inspect the file located in `target/run/{project_name}/models/{model_path}`.

You can copy this SQL and execute it directly in your data warehouse console to pinpoint the specific line causing the syntax error.
