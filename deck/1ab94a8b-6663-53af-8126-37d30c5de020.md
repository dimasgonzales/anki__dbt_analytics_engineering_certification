  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The Reference Text only partially mentions that 'tags' has a different merge behavior, but it does not specify whether this behavior is additive or confirm the additive nature of 'pre-hook' and 'post-hook', nor does it mention 'meta' configurations. Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the entire answer."

<front>

Which dbt configurations are 'additive' (merged) rather than 'clobbering' (overridden) when defined in multiple places?

</front>

<back>

The `tags`, `pre-hook`, and `post-hook` configurations are additive. If defined at multiple levels, dbt concatenates the lists.

Additionally, `meta` configurations are merged as dictionaries (specific keys overwrite general ones, new keys are added).
