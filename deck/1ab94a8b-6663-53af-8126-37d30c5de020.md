<front>

Which dbt configurations are 'additive' (merged) rather than 'clobbering' (overridden) when defined in multiple places?

<back>

The `tags`, `pre-hook`, and `post-hook` configurations are additive. If defined at multiple levels, dbt concatenates the lists.

Additionally, `meta` configurations are merged as dictionaries (specific keys overwrite general ones, new keys are added).
