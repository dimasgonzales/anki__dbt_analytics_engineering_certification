<front>

You are running dbt in an environment with limited disk space and need to disable writing logs to the `dbt.log` file entirely. Which command should you use?

</front>

<back>

Use the `--log-level-file` flag set to `none`.

Example:
```bash
dbt run --log-level-file none
```
This preserves console output (defaulting to INFO) while preventing file writes.
