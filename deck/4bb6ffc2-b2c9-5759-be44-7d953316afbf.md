  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text supports that the `--select` flag limits nodes in the catalog, but it does not mention adapter-dependency or support for partial generation by specific adapters like Snowflake or BigQuery, which is part of the answer. Therefore, there is insufficient information to fully verify the answer."

What is the impact of using the `--select` flag with `dbt docs generate`?

<back>

The `--select` flag instructs dbt to generate a catalog only for the specified nodes, potentially reducing run time. However, this feature is adapter-dependent; some adapters support partial generation (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery), while others force a full catalog build regardless of the flag.
