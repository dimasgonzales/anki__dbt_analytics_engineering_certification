  explanation: "The reference text explicitly supports that `--select` limits nodes for catalog generation, which aligns with part of the answer, but it does not mention adapter-dependency or support for specific adapters like Snowflake and BigQuery, so the complete answer cannot be verified."

<front>

What is the impact of using the `--select` flag with `dbt docs generate`?

<back>

The `--select` flag instructs dbt to generate a catalog only for the specified nodes, potentially reducing run time. However, this feature is adapter-dependent; some adapters support partial generation (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery), while others force a full catalog build regardless of the flag.
