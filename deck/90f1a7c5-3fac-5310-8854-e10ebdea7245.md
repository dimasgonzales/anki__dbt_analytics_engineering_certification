What is the primary trade-off between using `view` and `table` materializations regarding freshness and performance?

**View**: Zero build time (instant freshness), but slower query performance for downstream users as transformations run on every select.

**Table**: Slower build time (must write data to storage), but faster query performance for downstream users as results are pre-computed.
