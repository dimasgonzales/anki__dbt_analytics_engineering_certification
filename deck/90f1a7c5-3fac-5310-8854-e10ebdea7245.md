  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly supports the trade-off described: views provide fresh data with slower query performance, while tables offer faster query performance with data storage that implies build time."
  citation:
    quote: "Pros: No additional data is stored, views on top of source data will always have the latest records in them. Cons: Views that perform a significant transformation, or are stacked on top of other views, are slow to query."

<front>

What is the primary trade-off between using `view` and `table` materializations regarding freshness and performance?

<back>

**View**: Zero build time (instant freshness), but slower query performance for downstream users as transformations run on every select.

**Table**: Slower build time (must write data to storage), but faster query performance for downstream users as results are pre-computed.
