<front>

You are running a dbt Cloud job with state-aware orchestration enabled. You modify the SQL logic of `model_A` but leave the independent `model_B` untouched. What is the expected outcome for these models in the next run?

</front>

<back>

`model_A` will rebuild because its state hash has changed. `model_B` will be "reused" (skipped) because its hash matches the cached state, optimizing the run duration.
