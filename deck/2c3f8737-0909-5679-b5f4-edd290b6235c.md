Which two built-in generic tests must be applied to a primary key column to effectively validate a model's grain?

You must apply `unique` and `not_null` tests. The `unique` test ensures there are no duplicate records for the key, and `not_null` ensures every record has a valid identifier.

Example config:
```yaml
columns:
  - name: order_id
    tests:
      - unique
      - not_null
```
