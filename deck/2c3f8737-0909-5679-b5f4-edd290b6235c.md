  explanation: "The reference text discusses the importance of testing primary keys for completeness and uniqueness but does not explicitly name the built-in generic tests 'unique' and 'not_null' as the required tests. It lacks specific information on which two built-in tests must be applied."

Which two built-in generic tests must be applied to a primary key column to effectively validate a model's grain?

</front>

<back>

You must apply `unique` and `not_null` tests. The `unique` test ensures there are no duplicate records for the key, and `not_null` ensures every record has a valid identifier.

Example config:
```yaml
columns:
  - name: order_id
    tests:
      - unique
      - not_null
```
