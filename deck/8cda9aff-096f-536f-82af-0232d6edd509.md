<front>

A model is configured as `materialized: view` in `dbt_project.yml`, but contains `{{ config(materialized='table') }}` in the SQL file. How will dbt materialize this model?

</front>

<back>

dbt will materialize the model as a **table**.

The in-file config block takes precedence over configurations defined in `dbt_project.yml` or YAML property files.
