  explanation: "The Reference Text does not contain specific information about how dbt parses references (e.g., {{ ref() }} in SQL or dbt.ref() in Python) or the exact execution order in mixed-language DAGs. It mentions general DAG-based execution but lacks details on dependency graph construction from references."

<front>

You have a DAG where a SQL model `stg_users` feeds into a Python model `int_ml_scoring`, which feeds into a SQL model `final_dashboard`. How does dbt handle the execution order?

<back>

dbt parses the references in both languages (`{{ ref() }}` in SQL and `dbt.ref()` in Python) to build a single dependency graph. It will execute `stg_users` (SQL), then `int_ml_scoring` (Python), and finally `final_dashboard` (SQL) strictly in that order, regardless of the language implementation.
