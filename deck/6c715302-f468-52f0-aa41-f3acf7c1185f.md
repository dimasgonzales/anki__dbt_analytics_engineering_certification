<front>

You receive an error trying to add `contract: {enforced: true}` to an intermediate model. The model config is shown below. What is the cause?
```sql
{{ config(materialized='ephemeral') }}
SELECT ...
```

</front>

---

<back>

The error occurs because `ephemeral` models cannot have enforced contracts. Since ephemeral models are interpolated as CTEs and do not create physical database objects (DDL), dbt cannot enforce schema constraints on them.
