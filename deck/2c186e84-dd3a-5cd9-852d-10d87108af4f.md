  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text discusses grants configuration and behavior with lists of grantees and the '+' prefix, but does not mention or provide evidence about the specific effects of setting a privilege to an empty list ([]) or an empty dictionary ({}). Therefore, it cannot verify the answer."

<front>

In the context of dbt `grants` configuration, what is the difference between setting a privilege to an empty list (`[]`) versus an empty dictionary (`{}`)?

<back>

An empty list (`'select': []`) tells dbt to **revoke** all access for that privilege. An empty dictionary (or removing the config) tells dbt to **ignore** grant management entirely, leaving existing permissions as-is.
