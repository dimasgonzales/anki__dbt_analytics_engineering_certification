  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text confirms that an empty list in grants configuration revokes all access for a privilege, and removing or not having the config causes dbt to ignore grant management, which directly supports the answer."

    quote: "To have dbt revoke all existing grants from a node, provide an empty list of grantees. If you delete the entire `+grants` section, dbt assumes you no longer want it to manage grants and doesn't change anything."

<front>

In the context of dbt `grants` configuration, what is the difference between setting a privilege to an empty list (`[]`) versus an empty dictionary (`{}`)?

<back>

An empty list (`'select': []`) tells dbt to **revoke** all access for that privilege. An empty dictionary (or removing the config) tells dbt to **ignore** grant management entirely, leaving existing permissions as-is.
