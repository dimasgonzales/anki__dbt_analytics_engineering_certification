<front>

You have defined a model contract specifying `customer_id` as an `int`, but your SQL transformation logic outputs it as a `varchar`. What happens when you run `dbt run`?

The run fails immediately before materialization. Because `contract: enforced: true` is set, dbt compares the compiled SQL's return types against the YAML definition and stops execution if there is a mismatch to prevent polluting the warehouse.
