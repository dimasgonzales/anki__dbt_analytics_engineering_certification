<front>

What is the primary purpose of the `{% if execute %}` block when using `run_query()` in dbt?

</front>

<back>

It ensures that the code processing the query results only runs during the execution phase, preventing compilation errors.

During the 'parse' phase, the query has not run yet, so the results object is empty/None. Attempting to iterate over results without this check causes the compilation to fail.
