Why is it necessary to consult the dbt Core Version Compatibility Matrix when setting up a new environment?

<back>

Specific versions of `dbt-core` are only compatible with specific minor versions of Python. Using a Python version that is too new (e.g., Python 3.12 with dbt v1.5) or too old will cause installation errors or runtime failures because dependencies may not compile or install correctly.
