  explanation: "The reference text focuses on dbt Core release tracks, version upgrades, and compatibility between dbt-core and adapter plugins, but does not mention or address Python version compatibility. Therefore, there is insufficient information to support or contradict the answer."

<back>

Specific versions of `dbt-core` are only compatible with specific minor versions of Python. Using a Python version that is too new (e.g., Python 3.12 with dbt v1.5) or too old will cause installation errors or runtime failures because dependencies may not compile or install correctly.
