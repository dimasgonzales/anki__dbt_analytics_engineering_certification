  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The Reference Text describes properties of exposures, such as name, type, and owner, and specifies allowed values for type, but it does not explicitly state which properties are mandatory or required when defining an exposure. Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the claim about mandatory properties."

<front>

What are the three mandatory properties required when defining an `exposure` in a dbt `.yml` file?

<back>

The three required properties are `name`, `type`, and `owner`. The `type` property must be one of the specific allowed values (dashboard, notebook, analysis, ml, application), and the `owner` property identifies the contact person or team responsible for the downstream asset.
