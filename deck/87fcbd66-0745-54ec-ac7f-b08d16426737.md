    quote: "One of dbt’s more popular open source packages is [dbt_project_evaluator] , which tests your project against a set of well established dbt best practices. dbt Explorer now surfaces many of the same recommendations directly within the explorer UI using the metadata from the Discovery API, without any need to download and run the package!"
