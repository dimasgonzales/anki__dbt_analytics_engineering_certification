<front>

You are setting up a new developer who uses the schema `dbt_jdoe` in their `profiles.yml`. Assuming they have the correct database permissions, do you need to manually run SQL to create this schema before they can use dbt?

<back>

No. dbt acts as a schema manager and will automatically create the `dbt_jdoe` schema the first time the developer runs `dbt run` or `dbt build`, provided their credentials have `CREATE SCHEMA` privileges.
