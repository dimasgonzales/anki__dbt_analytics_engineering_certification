<front>

Model A contains the code `select * from {{ ref('model_b') }}`. When you execute `dbt run`, which model executes first and why?

<back>

**Model B** executes first.

dbt parses the `ref()` function to identify that Model A depends on Model B, placing Model B upstream in the DAG to ensure data is available before Model A runs.
