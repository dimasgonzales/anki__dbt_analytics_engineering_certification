  explanation: "The reference text discusses model processing according to lineage and dependencies in the context of dbt build, but does not explicitly state that the ref() function causes Model B to execute first in dbt run, nor does it provide direct evidence to verify the specific scenario."

<front>

Model A contains the code `select * from {{ ref('model_b') }}`. When you execute `dbt run`, which model executes first and why?

</front>

<back>

**Model B** executes first.

dbt parses the `ref()` function to identify that Model A depends on Model B, placing Model B upstream in the DAG to ensure data is available before Model A runs.
