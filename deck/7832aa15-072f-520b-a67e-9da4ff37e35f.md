<front>

What specific artifact file is generated by `dbt parse` to assist with analyzing project load times?

</front>

<back>

The `target/perf_info.json` file. 

This artifact contains detailed timing breakdowns (e.g., `parse_project_elapsed`) that help users understand how long dbt takes to load and parse the project configuration.
