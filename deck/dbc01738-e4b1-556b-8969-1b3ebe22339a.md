<front>

What configuration is required in dbt to push descriptions defined in YAML files to the actual database objects (tables and views)?

You must enable the `persist_docs` configuration in `dbt_project.yml`. This allows dbt to execute `COMMENT ON` statements during model building for relations and/or columns.

```yaml
models:
  +persist_docs:
    relation: true
    columns: true
```

</back>
