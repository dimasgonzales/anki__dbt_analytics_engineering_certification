<front>

You receive a validation error when compiling the following exposure configuration. What are the two specific errors?

```yaml
exposures:
  - name: finance_report
    type: report
    maturity: stable
```

<back>

1. `type: report` is invalid. It must be one of the allowed types (e.g., `dashboard`, `analysis`).
2. `maturity: stable` is invalid. Allowed values are strictly `high`, `medium`, or `low`.
