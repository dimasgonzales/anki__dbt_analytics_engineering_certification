  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly shows that to use the 'insert_overwrite' incremental strategy in BigQuery, the model must have a 'partition_by' configuration. It states that the table must be partitioned and provides an example configuration with 'partition_by' set, which directly supports the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "The table must be partitioned (daily, hourly, etc.), and the model will drop and rebuild only the partitions that have new or updated data. Here’s how we configured a model to use 'insert_overwrite' on BigQuery: {{ config( materialized = 'incremental', incremental_strategy = 'insert_overwrite', partition_by = { 'field': 'transaction_date', 'data_type': 'date' } ) }}"

<front>

What specific model configuration is required to use the `insert_overwrite` incremental strategy in BigQuery?

<back>

The model must have a `partition_by` configuration. The `insert_overwrite` strategy works by dropping and replacing specific partitions, so dbt must know which column defines the partition boundaries.
