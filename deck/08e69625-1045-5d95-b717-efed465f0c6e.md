  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly shows that exposures in dbt are defined with a 'depends_on' key to list dependencies, which directly supports the answer that a missing or empty 'depends_on' key would cause the exposure to be a lonely node in the DAG."

<front>

You have defined an exposure named `monthly_kpis`, but it appears as a lonely node in the DAG with no connection to your dbt models. What is likely missing in the YAML configuration?

<back>

The exposure is missing the `depends_on` key (or it is empty). To fix the lineage, you must add references to the specific models feeding the dashboard.

Example:
```yaml
depends_on:
  - ref('fct_monthly_kpis')
  - source('salesforce', 'opportunities')
```

</back>
