<front>

You notice that a column defined as `data_type: numeric` in your model contract is losing decimal precision (truncating to integers) in the database. What is the likely cause and fix?

</front>

<back>

The database likely defaults `numeric` to a scale of 0 if not specified. To fix this, explicitly define the precision and scale in the YAML contract.

Example:
```yaml
- name: revenue
  data_type: numeric(38, 2)
```
