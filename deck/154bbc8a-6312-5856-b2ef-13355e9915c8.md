<front>

You are setting up a CI/CD pipeline to generate documentation. You notice the Source Freshness section is empty despite running `dbt run` and `dbt docs generate`. How do you fix this?

You must add `dbt source freshness` to the pipeline before generating docs.

`dbt run` builds models but does not check source metadata. `sources.json` is required to populate the freshness status in the documentation.
