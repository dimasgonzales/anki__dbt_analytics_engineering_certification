You need to determine which BI dashboards will be impacted if you drop the `dim_customers` model. How can dbt enable this impact analysis?

You should define an **exposure** in a YAML file that references the dashboard and lists `dim_customers` in its `depends_on` property.

```yaml
exposures:
  - name: customer_dashboard
    type: dashboard
    depends_on:
      - ref('dim_customers')
```
This adds the dashboard to the DAG, allowing you to visualize the dependency in the docs.
