  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that users need authorization to create new schemas for storing test failures, which directly supports the answer that CREATE SCHEMA permissions are required."

<front>

What specific database privilege is required for a user to successfully run `dbt test --store-failures` for the first time in a new environment?

The user requires **CREATE SCHEMA** permissions. Because dbt separates audit data into a new schema (e.g., `..._dbt_test__audit`), the user must be authorized to create new schemas, not just tables within an existing schema.
