<front>

Your `dbt_project.yml` grants `select` to `global_read_role`. For a specific finance model, you also want to grant access to `finance_role` without removing the global role. How do you configure this?

Prefix the privilege name with `+` to append to the existing list instead of replacing it.
```sql
{{ config(
