  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms the precedence order for config values as listed in the answer, with in-file config() block being most specific, followed by .yml file config, then project file config."
  citation:
    quote: "The most specific config always takes precedence. This generally follows the order above: an in-file `config()` block --> properties defined in a `.yml` file --> config defined in the project file."

<front>

What are the precedence rules that decide what config values apply to a given resource?

1. in-file Jinja `config()` block
2. resource-specific YAML file config
3. `dbt_project.yml` config

Basically, from most specific to least specific.
