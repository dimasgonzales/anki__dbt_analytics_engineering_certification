  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly describes dbt debug as a utility function to test database connections and display debug information, including dbt version and system environment (e.g., OS), which supports the core claims in the answer. However, the specific mention of the --config-dir flag is not found in the provided text."

It is a utility function to show various debug information such as your dbt version, os info, profiles.yml location, etc. Passing the `--config-dir` flag will show you where your .dbt config directory is located.
