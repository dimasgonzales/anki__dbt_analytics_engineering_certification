  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer is explicitly supported by the reference text, which confirms that dbt handles materialization changes from view to table by first dropping the view and then creating the table, aligning with the steps described."
  citation:
    quote: "To do this, dbt had to first run a `drop view` statement (or API call on BigQuery), then a `create table as` statement."

<front>

A model currently exists as a `view` in your warehouse. You change the configuration to `materialized='table'` and run `dbt run`. What steps does dbt take?

<back>

1. dbt detects a type mismatch (existing View vs configured Table).
2. It **drops** the existing view.
3. It **creates** the new table.

dbt ensures the old object type is removed before creating the new one to avoid naming conflicts.
