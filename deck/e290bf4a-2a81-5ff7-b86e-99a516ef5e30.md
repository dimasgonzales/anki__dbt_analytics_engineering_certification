<front>

A model currently exists as a `view` in your warehouse. You change the configuration to `materialized='table'` and run `dbt run`. What steps does dbt take?

<back>

1. dbt detects a type mismatch (existing View vs configured Table).
2. It **drops** the existing view.
3. It **creates** the new table.

dbt ensures the old object type is removed before creating the new one to avoid naming conflicts.
