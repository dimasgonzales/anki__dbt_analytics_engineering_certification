  explanation: "The reference text explicitly describes the functions of the '+' and '@' operators, matching the answer. For '+', it selects children (e.g., 'my_model+' selects the model and all its children), and for '@', it selects the model, its children, and the parents of its children, confirming the broader scope."

<front>

What is the functional difference between the plus (`+`) operator and the at (`@`) operator in dbt selector syntax?

<back>

The `+` operator selects immediate parents (left of model) or children (right of model). The `@` operator is broader: it selects the model, its descendants (children), and the **parents of those descendants**.

The `@` operator is specifically designed to build a model and everything downstream of it, while ensuring all necessary upstream dependencies for those downstream models are also included.
