What is the functional difference between the plus (`+`) operator and the at (`@`) operator in dbt selector syntax?

<back>

The `+` operator selects immediate parents (left of model) or children (right of model). The `@` operator is broader: it selects the model, its descendants (children), and the **parents of those descendants**.

The `@` operator is specifically designed to build a model and everything downstream of it, while ensuring all necessary upstream dependencies for those downstream models are also included.
