  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text discusses cross-project references requiring a two-argument `ref()` function and mentions package macros, but does not explicitly address how to reference models from installed packages. Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the answer about using a single-argument `ref()` for package models."

<front>

You have installed a package that contains a model named `finance_report`. You want to build a downstream model in your own project that selects from it. How do you reference the package model?

</front>

<back>

Use the standard `ref()` function with the package model's name. Once installed, package models are part of your project's graph.

```sql
select * from {{ ref('finance_report') }}
```

</back>
