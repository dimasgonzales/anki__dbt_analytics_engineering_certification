<front>

You need to run only the models located in the `marts/finance` directory that ALSO have the tag `nightly`. How would you format the select command?

<back>

You must use a comma-separated list to enforce Intersection (AND) logic.

```bash
dbt run --select "path:marts/finance,tag:nightly"
```

If you used a space, it would run all finance models OR all nightly models.
