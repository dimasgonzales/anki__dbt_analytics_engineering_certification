<front>

A `unique` test on your `customers` model is failing. How would you troubleshoot which specific records are causing the failure?

</front>

1. Navigate to the `target/compiled` directory.
2. Locate the compiled SQL for the failing test (usually in `target/compiled/{project}/models/...`).
3. Copy the query and run it in your data warehouse.

The results will show exactly which rows are duplicates (since tests return failing rows).
