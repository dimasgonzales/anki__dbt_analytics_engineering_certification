How can you access a dictionary mapping DAG node ids to dictionary representations of those nodes? What is the main "gotcha" to be aware of when accessing this data?

The `graph` context variable contains this dictionary. See the link below for a full description of its structure/contents.
  
  
The main thing to watch out for is that the *model* entries in the graph will be incomplete/incorrect during parsing, so any code accessing model metadata through this variable should be wrapped in a `{% if execute %}` block.  
  
The Jinja `model` variable is a kind of shortcut to get to the `graph` entry for the current model.
