  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text from 'project-config/rank_5.md' explicitly lists 'target' as an available context variable for accessing the active environment in dbt configurations, and it provides an example using 'target.name' to conditionally set materialization based on the environment, which directly supports the answer."

<front>

Which Jinja object is used to access the configuration of the active environment (e.g., 'dev', 'prod') within a model?

<back>

The `target` object (specifically `target.name`). It allows you to conditionally change SQL generation based on the environment dbt is running against.
Example: `{% if target.name == 'dev' %} ... {% endif %}`
