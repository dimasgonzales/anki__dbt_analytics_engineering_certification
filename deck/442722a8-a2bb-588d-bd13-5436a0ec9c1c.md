<front>

You have a static CSV file containing unchanging country codes that needs to be version-controlled and joined with your models. How should you implement this in dbt?

</front>

---

<back>

Place the CSV file in your project's seeds directory and execute `dbt seed`. This command will create a table in your warehouse populated with the data from the CSV, allowing you to reference it in models using the `ref()` function.
