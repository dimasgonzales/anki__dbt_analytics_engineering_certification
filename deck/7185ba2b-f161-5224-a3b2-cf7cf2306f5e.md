  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text confirms that both dbt Core and dbt Cloud CLI are invoked using the same command name 'dbt', which can cause path conflicts and ambiguity in execution, supporting the answer's claim."
  citation:
    quote: "both the Cloud CLI and dbt Core are invoked by running `dbt`. This can create path conflicts if your operating system selects one over the other based on your $PATH environment variable (settings)."

<back>

Both dbt Core and the dbt Cloud CLI use the same binary command name (`dbt`). Installing them globally on the same machine causes path conflicts, leading to ambiguity regarding which version (local Core vs. remote Cloud) is executing your commands.
