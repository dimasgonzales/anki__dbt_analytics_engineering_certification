What three specific meta-fields does dbt append to a snapshot table to track the validity window of a record?

</front>

<back>

dbt adds:
1.  **`dbt_valid_from`**: The timestamp when the record state became effective.
2.  **`dbt_valid_to`**: The timestamp when the record state stopped being effective (or `null` if current).
3.  **`dbt_scd_id`**: A unique key generated for each version of the record.
