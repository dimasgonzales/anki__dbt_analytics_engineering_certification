  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Answer correctly states that write commands block other write commands and are limited to one at a time, while read commands can run in parallel with other reads and with a single write command. The Reference Text explicitly supports this with descriptions of command types and concurrency rules."
  citation:
    quote: "**Write** ... Limited to one invocation at any given time ... **Read** ... Can have multiple invocations in parallel ... This means read commands can run in parallel with other read commands and a single write command."

What is the primary difference between 'Read' and 'Write' commands in dbt regarding execution concurrency?

<back>

Write commands (e.g., `dbt run`, `dbt build`) modify data and block other commands, meaning only one can run at a time per environment to prevent conflicts. Read commands (e.g., `dbt compile`, `dbt test`) do not modify data and can run in parallel with other read commands or a single write command.
