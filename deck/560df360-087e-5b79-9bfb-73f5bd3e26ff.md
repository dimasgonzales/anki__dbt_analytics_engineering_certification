What is the primary difference between 'Read' and 'Write' commands in dbt regarding execution concurrency?

<back>

Write commands (e.g., `dbt run`, `dbt build`) modify data and block other commands, meaning only one can run at a time per environment to prevent conflicts. Read commands (e.g., `dbt compile`, `dbt test`) do not modify data and can run in parallel with other read commands or a single write command.
