<front>

You are using an installed package named `ad_reporting`. You successfully `ref()` a model inside it that is marked `access: private`. Why does dbt allow this reference instead of raising an error?

<back>

This is allowed because the `ad_reporting` package likely has not enabled `restrict-access: True` in its `dbt_project.yml`.

Without this setting, dbt treats package models as if they are local to your project, bypassing the access modifiers defined within the package.
