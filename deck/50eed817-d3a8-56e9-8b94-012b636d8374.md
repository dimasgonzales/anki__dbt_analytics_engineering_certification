<front>

What is the function of the `--static` flag when generating dbt documentation?

<back>

The `--static` flag forces dbt to bundle the contents of `manifest.json` and `catalog.json` directly into the `index.html` file. This allows the documentation to be viewed locally or shared as a single file without needing a web server to handle CORS/file requests.
