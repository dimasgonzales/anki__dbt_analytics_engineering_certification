  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Answer correctly lists the four indirect_selection modes (eager, cautious, buildable, empty) and identifies eager as the default, which is explicitly supported by the Reference Text. The descriptions of each mode align with the evidence provided."
  citation:
    quote: "We call this 'eager' indirect selection. You can optionally switch the indirect selection mode to 'cautious', 'buildable', or 'empty' (from selectors/rank_6.md), and 'indirect_selection: eager  # default' confirms the default mode."

<front>

What are the four `indirect_selection` modes available in dbt and what is the default?

</front>

<back>

1. `eager` (default): Selects all tests touching the selected node.
2. `cautious`: Excludes tests if they touch other unselected parents.
3. `buildable`: Excludes tests touching unselected parents unless those parents have a selected ancestor.
4. `empty`: Ignores all attached tests.
