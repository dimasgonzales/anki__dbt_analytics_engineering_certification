What are the four `indirect_selection` modes available in dbt and what is the default?

</front>

<back>

1. `eager` (default): Selects all tests touching the selected node.
2. `cautious`: Excludes tests if they touch other unselected parents.
3. `buildable`: Excludes tests touching unselected parents unless those parents have a selected ancestor.
4. `empty`: Ignores all attached tests.
