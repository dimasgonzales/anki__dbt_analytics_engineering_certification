  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text confirms that package dependencies add source code, aligning with part of the answer, but it does not provide information on project dependencies using a metadata service, referencing models as APIs without parsing source code, or offering better performance and encapsulation. Therefore, the answer cannot be fully verified based on the given evidence."

What is the primary difference between a 'package' dependency and a 'project' dependency in dbt?

<back>

A **package** dependency installs the full source code (macros, models) into your environment, which is best for libraries like `dbt_utils`. A **project** dependency (dbt Mesh) uses a metadata service to reference public models as APIs without parsing the upstream source code, offering better performance and encapsulation.
