What is the primary difference between a 'package' dependency and a 'project' dependency in dbt?

A **package** dependency installs the full source code (macros, models) into your environment, which is best for libraries like `dbt_utils`. A **project** dependency (dbt Mesh) uses a metadata service to reference public models as APIs without parsing the upstream source code, offering better performance and encapsulation.
