  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer accurately reflects the primary purpose described in the reference text: development environments enable safe coding and testing without affecting live data, and production environments contain finalized data for end users. The reference text explicitly supports this separation to avoid impacting users and ensure reliable data transformations."

    quote: "environments are used to enable engineers to develop and test code without impacting the users of their software... the production environment refers to the relations (for example, schemas, tables, and views) that your end users query"

<front>

What is the primary purpose of separating 'Development' and 'Production' environments in a dbt project?

<back>

Development environments allow developers to write and test code safely in personal schemas (e.g., `dbt_alice`) without affecting live data. Production environments contain finalized tables and views in a shared schema (e.g., `analytics`) that end users and BI tools query.
