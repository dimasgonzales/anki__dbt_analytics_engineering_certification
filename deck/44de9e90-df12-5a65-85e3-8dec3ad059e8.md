  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text confirms that 'snapshot-paths' is the field in dbt_project.yml used to specify custom directories for snapshots, and the default is 'snapshots'. The additional statement about co-location with seeds is not addressed in the provided evidence but does not contradict the text."

What **dbt\_project.yml** field is used to specify a custom list of directories where snapshots are located? What is the default?

**snapshot-paths**. Default is `snapshots`. Unlike with seeds, you cannot co-locate models and snapshots.
