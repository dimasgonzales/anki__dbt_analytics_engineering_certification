<front>

Given the following configuration in `dbt_project.yml`, what will happen if a test configured with `severity: warn` fails?

```yaml
flags:
  warn_error_options:
    error: all
    warn: []
```

</front>

<back>

The dbt run will **fail (error)**. Because `error` is set to `all`, the test warning is promoted to an error, stopping the execution or returning a non-zero exit code, just as if the test had `severity: error`.
