<front>

You are refactoring a query and the row counts match between the legacy table and the new dbt model, but you suspect specific column values might differ. How can you verify this?

</front>

<back>

Use the `audit_helper` package's macro `compare_relations`.

It generates a query that compares all columns row-by-row, returning a summary of which rows match perfectly versus which contain discrepancies, rather than just checking the total row count.
