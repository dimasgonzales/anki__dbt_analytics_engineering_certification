<front>

You wrote a custom materialization that executes the main SQL statement successfully without errors, but the table does not appear in the database after the run finishes. What is the most likely cause?

<back>

You likely forgot to include `{{ adapter.commit() }}` at the end of the materialization block.

Without an explicit commit, dbt closes the connection at the end of the run, causing the database to **roll back** the uncommitted transaction containing your table creation.
