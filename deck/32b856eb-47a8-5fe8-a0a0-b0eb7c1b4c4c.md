<front>

You need to upload a static lookup table that contains sensitive PII (Personally Identifiable Information) to be used in a join. Should you use a dbt seed for this? Explain why or why not.

No, you should **not** use a dbt seed for PII. Since seeds are committed to git, the sensitive data would be permanently recorded in the version control history and accessible to anyone with read access to the repository. Instead, load the data directly to the warehouse with restricted permissions and reference it as a Source.
