<front>

You are running dbt Core locally using Python 3.11. You attempt to run a Python model configured for Snowflake, which currently supports Python 3.9. Will this execution fail due to the version mismatch?

<back>

No, the execution will not fail due to this mismatch. The local environment runs the dbt CLI, while the Python model runs entirely on the data platform. As long as the platform supports the version configured in the model (3.9), the local CLI version (3.11) does not need to match.
