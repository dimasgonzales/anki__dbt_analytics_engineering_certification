<front>

A developer has installed the dbt Cloud CLI, but when they run `dbt run`, it executes locally against their Postgres database instead of the Cloud infrastructure. What is the likely cause and solution?

<back>

The shell is likely resolving the `dbt` command to a global dbt Core installation rather than the Cloud CLI. 
**Solution:** Use an alias to explicitly target the Cloud executable:
```bash
alias dbt-cloud='/path/to/cloud-cli/dbt'
dbt-cloud run
```

</back>
