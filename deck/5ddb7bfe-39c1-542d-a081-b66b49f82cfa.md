<front>

You have a model `orders` with a `not_null` test defined on `order_id`. If you execute the command below, exactly which resources will run?

```bash
$ dbt run --select orders
```

</front>

---

<back>

Only the `orders` model materialization will run.

The `dbt run` command does NOT include indirect selection of tests by default. To run both the model and its tests, you should use `dbt build`.
