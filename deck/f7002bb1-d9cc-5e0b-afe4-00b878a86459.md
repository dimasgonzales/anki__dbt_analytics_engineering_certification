<front>

When referencing a versioned model using `{{ ref('model_name') }}` without a version argument, which version does dbt resolve to?

It resolves to the version configured as the `latest_version`.

For example, if `latest_version: 2` is set, the unpinned reference automatically compiles to the database object associated with version 2 (e.g., `model_name_v2`).
