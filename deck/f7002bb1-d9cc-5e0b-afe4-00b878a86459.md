  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that an unpinned reference to a versioned model resolves to the latest version, as demonstrated in the example where it resolves to v2 and explains it will update when a new version is marked latest."

<front>

When referencing a versioned model using `{{ ref('model_name') }}` without a version argument, which version does dbt resolve to?

<back>

It resolves to the version configured as the `latest_version`.

For example, if `latest_version: 2` is set, the unpinned reference automatically compiles to the database object associated with version 2 (e.g., `model_name_v2`).
