  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer aligns with the reference text, which describes views as ideal for building blocks and small datasets (supporting intermediate use), tables as most performant for end-user access like BI tools and marts, and incremental models for large datasets to enable performant building and access."
  citation:
    quote: "Tables are the most performant materialization, as they just return the transformed data when they’re queried, with no need to reprocess it. This makes tables great for things end users touch, like a mart that services a popular dashboard."

What are the primary use cases for `view`, `table`, and `incremental` materializations?

- **View**: Best for starting development and models used only by other dbt models (Intermediate).
- **Table**: Best for models queried directly by BI tools requiring high performance (Marts).
- **Incremental**: Best for very large datasets where rebuilding the full table is too expensive or slow.
