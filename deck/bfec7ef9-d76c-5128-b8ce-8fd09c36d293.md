What are the primary use cases for `view`, `table`, and `incremental` materializations?

<back>

- **View**: Best for starting development and models used only by other dbt models (Intermediate).
- **Table**: Best for models queried directly by BI tools requiring high performance (Marts).
- **Incremental**: Best for very large datasets where rebuilding the full table is too expensive or slow.
