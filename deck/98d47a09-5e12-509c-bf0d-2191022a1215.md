  explanation: "The Reference Text only provides evidence for the availability of 'schemas' and 'database_schemas' in 'on-run-end' hooks, but does not mention the 'results' variable or explicitly confirm exclusivity or behavior in other contexts such as models, generic macros, or 'on-run-start' hooks."

<front>

In which specific context of the dbt lifecycle are the variables `schemas`, `database_schemas`, and `results` available?

</front>

---

<back>

These variables are exclusively available within **`on-run-end` hooks**. If referenced in models, generic macros, or `on-run-start` hooks, they will evaluate to `none` because the run metadata has not yet been generated.
