<front>

In which specific context of the dbt lifecycle are the variables `schemas`, `database_schemas`, and `results` available?

</front>

<back>

These variables are exclusively available within **`on-run-end` hooks**. If referenced in models, generic macros, or `on-run-start` hooks, they will evaluate to `none` because the run metadata has not yet been generated.
