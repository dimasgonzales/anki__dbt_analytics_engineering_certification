<front>

Given the following `dbt_project.yml` configuration, which delimiter will be used for a seed located in `seeds/marketing/campaigns.csv`?

```yaml
seeds:
  +delimiter: ","
  marketing:
    +delimiter: ";"
```

</front>

<back>

The semicolon (`;`) will be used.

The configuration under the `marketing` directory key is more specific than the root-level configuration, so it overrides the global comma default for all seeds within that subdirectory.
