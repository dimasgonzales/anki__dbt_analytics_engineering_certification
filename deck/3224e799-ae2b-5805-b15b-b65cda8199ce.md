  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text confirms that seed configurations are applied hierarchically, with more specific settings (such as subdirectory configurations) overriding more general ones. In this case, the delimiter specified under the 'marketing' subdirectory takes precedence over the root-level configuration."

    quote: "configurations applied to a `marketing` subdirectory will take precedence over configurations applied to the entire `jaffle_shop` project, and configurations defined in a specific seed's properties will override configurations defined in `dbt_project.yml`."

<front>

Given the following `dbt_project.yml` configuration, which delimiter will be used for a seed located in `seeds/marketing/campaigns.csv`?

```yaml
seeds:
  +delimiter: ","
  marketing:
    +delimiter: ";"
```

</front>

<back>

The semicolon (`;`) will be used.

The configuration under the `marketing` directory key is more specific than the root-level configuration, so it overrides the global comma default for all seeds within that subdirectory.
