<front>

You need to update your project metadata to reflect a new patch release `1.0.1`, but you also need to ensure developers are using dbt Core v1.7 or higher. How should you configure `dbt_project.yml`?

<back>

You should update the `version` key for the project metadata and the `require-dbt-version` key for the environment requirement.

Example:
```yaml
name: 'my_project'
version: '1.0.1'
require-dbt-version: '>=1.7.0'
```
