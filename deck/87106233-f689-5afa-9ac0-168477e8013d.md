<front>

You want to run only the models located in the `marts/marketing` directory that are *also* tagged with `config:incremental`. How would you accomplish this?

You must use the comma separator to apply intersection logic (AND). Using a space would run everything in the directory plus everything with the tag.

Command:
```bash
dbt run --select marts.marketing,tag:config:incremental
```
