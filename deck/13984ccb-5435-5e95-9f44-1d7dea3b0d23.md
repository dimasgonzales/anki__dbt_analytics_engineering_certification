<front>

What is the order of precedence for dbt configuration flags (from highest to lowest priority)?

</front>

<back>

dbt resolves configuration in the following order:
1. **CLI Arguments** (Highest)
2. **Environment Variables**
3. **`flags` dictionary in `dbt_project.yml`**
4. **Internal Defaults** (Lowest)

The most specific setting (CLI) always overrides broader settings.
