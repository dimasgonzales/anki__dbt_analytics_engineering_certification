  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Answer accurately reflects the order of precedence for dbt configuration flags as described in the Reference Text, which explicitly states that CLI options have the highest priority, followed by environment variables, then values in dbt_project.yml, and finally internal defaults when none are set."
  citation:
    quote: "The most specific setting 'wins.' If you set the same flag in all three places, the CLI option will take precedence, followed by the environment variable, and finally, the value in `dbt_project.yml`. If you set the flag in none of those places, it will use the default value defined within dbt."

<front>

What is the order of precedence for dbt configuration flags (from highest to lowest priority)?

</front>

<back>

dbt resolves configuration in the following order:
1. **CLI Arguments** (Highest)
2. **Environment Variables**
3. **`flags` dictionary in `dbt_project.yml`**
4. **Internal Defaults** (Lowest)

The most specific setting (CLI) always overrides broader settings.
