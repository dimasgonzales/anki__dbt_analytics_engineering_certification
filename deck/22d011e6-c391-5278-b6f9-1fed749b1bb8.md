<front>

You want to configure a CI job to run only the new or modified models compared to your production branch. You have downloaded the production `manifest.json` to a folder named `./prod_state`. What command would you run?

</front>

<back>

You would run the `dbt build` command using the `state:modified` selector and point the `--state` flag to the directory containing the manifest.

Command:
```bash
dbt build --select state:modified --state ./prod_state
```

</back>
