<front>

You have initialized a `dbt_project.yml` file with valid YAML indentation, but `dbt debug` fails saying the project name is missing. What does this indicate about dbt's validation process?

<back>

It indicates that dbt validates **logical schema requirements** after checking YAML syntax. Even if the file is valid YAML, it is invalid for dbt if it lacks mandatory fields like:
```yaml
name: 'my_project'
```
