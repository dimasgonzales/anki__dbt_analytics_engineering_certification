<front>

You are building an interactive CLI tool that runs several dbt checks in a row. Users complain there is a long pause before *every* check. How would you modify the `dbtRunner` implementation to fix this?

<back>

The pause is likely caused by dbt parsing the project files for every command. You should invoke `dbt parse` once at startup, store the result, and inject the manifest into `dbtRunner(manifest=stored_manifest)` for all subsequent checks to skip the parsing phase.
