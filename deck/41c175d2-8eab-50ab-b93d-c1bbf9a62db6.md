  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explains the n-plus operator where an integer before '+' specifies the degree of ancestors to include, with the example '2+my_model' selecting first-degree ancestors, implying that '1+model_name' would select only first-degree ancestors, matching the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "dbt run --select \"2+my_model\"        # select my_model, its first-degree ancestors (\"parents\"), and its second-degree ancestors (\"grandparents\")"

<front>

What is the syntax to select a model and only its immediate (first-degree) parents?

<back>

You use the **1+** syntax:

```bash
dbt run --select 1+model_name
```

The integer defines the depth of the traversal. `1+` restricts the upstream selection to just the immediate parents.
