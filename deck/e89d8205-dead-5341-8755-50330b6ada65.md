<front>

You are running dbt via an orchestrator (like Airflow) and need to tag every log entry with the orchestrator's Run ID for debugging. How do you achieve this without changing the project code?

<back>

Set an environment variable with the specific prefix before running dbt.

Example:
```bash
export DBT_ENV_CUSTOM_ENV_AIRFLOW_RUN_ID="run_12345"
dbt run
```
This results in `AIRFLOW_RUN_ID` appearing inside the `info.extra` block of the generated logs.
