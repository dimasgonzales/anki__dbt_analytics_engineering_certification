How does the `dbt clone` command function on warehouses like Snowflake versus warehouses like Postgres?

<back>

On warehouses that support it (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery), `dbt clone` uses **zero-copy cloning** to copy metadata without duplicating physical storage. 

On warehouses without this feature (e.g., Postgres), dbt falls back to creating a **pointer view** (`select * from source`) to achieve a similar effect.
