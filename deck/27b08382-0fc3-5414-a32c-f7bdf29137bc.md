  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly confirms that dbt clone uses zero-copy cloning on supported data platforms like Snowflake and BigQuery, and falls back to creating pointer views on platforms without this feature, which matches the answer's description."
  citation:
    quote: "If your data platform supports zero-copy cloning of tables (Snowflake, Databricks, or BigQuery), and this model exists as a table in the source environment, dbt will create it in your target environment as a clone. Otherwise, dbt will create a simple pointer view (`select * from` the source object)"

How does the `dbt clone` command function on warehouses like Snowflake versus warehouses like Postgres?

On warehouses that support it (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery), `dbt clone` uses **zero-copy cloning** to copy metadata without duplicating physical storage. 

On warehouses without this feature (e.g., Postgres), dbt falls back to creating a **pointer view** (`select * from source`) to achieve a similar effect.
