<front>

What is the fundamental difference between the types of information defined in `dbt_project.yml` versus files like `schema.yml`?

<back>

`dbt_project.yml` is exclusively for **configurations** (how dbt runs/builds resources, e.g., `+materialized`).

Property files (like `schema.yml`) are for **properties** (metadata, e.g., `description`, `tests`, `columns`).
