<front>

You modify a logic calculation in `model_A` for a column that is NOT selected by the downstream `model_B`. In a CI job using dbt Fusion, will `model_B` be rebuilt?

</front>

<back>

No, `model_B` will likely skip rebuilding. Unlike standard dbt which interprets any change to a parent file as a trigger to rebuild children, Fusion's State-Aware Orchestration detects that the modified column in `model_A` is not part of the lineage for `model_B`, treating the dependency as stable.
