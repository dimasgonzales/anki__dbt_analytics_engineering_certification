<front>

You are building a staging model based on raw data loaded by an EL tool into a schema named `raw_stripe`. How should you reference the `payments` table to ensure dbt recognizes it as a raw dependency?

</front>

<back>

Define the source in a `.yml` file and use the `source()` function in your SQL.
```sql
select * from {{ source('raw_stripe', 'payments') }}
```
Hardcoding the name prevents dbt from tracking source freshness or visualizing the full lineage graph.
