  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that dbt run executes only models, but it does not specifically list the excluded resources (data tests, seeds, and snapshots) or mention dbt build, so there is insufficient information to fully verify the answer."

<front>

Which dbt resources are executed by the `dbt run` command, and which are specifically excluded?

`dbt run` specifically executes SQL models (tables and views). It **excludes** data tests, seeds, and snapshots. 

To execute all resources in dependency order, you would use `dbt build` instead.
