<front>

You are writing a macro that logs audit information and need to include the specific version of dbt being used for the run. How would you retrieve this information in Jinja?

Reference the `dbt_version` variable within your Jinja block.

Example:
```jinja
{% do log("Running dbt version: " ~ dbt_version, info=true) %}
```
