<front>

You need to optimize a model that joins three large tables, but you only need a subset of columns and rows from each. How should you structure the model using the Import CTE pattern?

</front>

<back>

Create an Import CTE for each table at the top of the file and perform **early filtering** immediately within these CTEs. Selecting only the necessary columns and rows reduces the data volume scanned before subsequent joins.

Example:
```sql
with orders as (
    select id, status 
    from {{ ref('orders') }}
    where order_date >= '2023-01-01'
),
...
```
