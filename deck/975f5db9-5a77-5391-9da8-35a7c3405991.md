Which Jinja function is required to reference raw data defined in YAML to ensure dbt can build the dependency graph?

The `source()` function. It replaces hardcoded schema/table names and takes two arguments: the source name and the table name.

Example:
```sql
FROM {{ source('stripe', 'payments') }}
```
