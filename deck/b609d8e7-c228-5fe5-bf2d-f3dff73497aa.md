<front>

Given the following `dbt_project.yml` snippet, why might dbt fail to apply the table materialization to the 'marketing' folder models?

```yaml
models:
  my_project:
    marketing:
      materialized: table
```

</front>

The configuration key is missing the `+` prefix.

Inside `dbt_project.yml`, when nesting configurations under folder names (like `marketing`), you must use `+materialized` to distinguish it from a folder named 'materialized'.

Correct syntax:
```yaml
+materialized: table
```

</back>
