<front>

You are using the `timestamp` strategy. A source record's `status` column changes from 'pending' to 'shipped', but the `updated_at` column in the source remains unchanged. Will dbt create a new snapshot row?

<back>

No. dbt detects changes by hashing the `unique_key` and the `updated_at` column to create the `dbt_scd_id`. Since the timestamp did not change, the hash remains identical, and dbt perceives the record as unchanged regardless of the data in the `status` column.
