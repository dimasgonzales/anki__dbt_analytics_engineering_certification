  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer correctly identifies the command to force an update when a version range in packages.yml is changed, as the reference text explicitly describes using the --upgrade flag for this purpose."

<front>

You updated a version range in `packages.yml`, but `dbt deps` keeps installing the old version. What command must you run to force the update?

<back>

You must run `dbt deps` with the `--upgrade` flag to ignore the lockfile and resolve new dependencies.

```bash
dbt deps --upgrade
```

</back>
