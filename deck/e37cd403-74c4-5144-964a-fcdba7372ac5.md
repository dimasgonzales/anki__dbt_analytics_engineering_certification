<front>

You created a macro named `override_schema_logic` to handle custom naming conventions, but dbt is ignoring it. Why?

dbt only overrides default behavior if the macro is named exactly `generate_schema_name`.

You must rename your macro to `generate_schema_name` for dbt to prioritize it over the built-in logic.
