<front>

You are debugging a `dbt run` error and notice the compiled SQL looks like `select * from "analytics"."public"."orders"`. Your database does not support quoted identifiers. How do you fix this?

</front>

<back>

You need to modify the `quoting` configuration in your `dbt_project.yml` or `sources.yml`.

Set the quoting properties to `false`:
```yaml
quoting:
  database: false
  schema: false
  identifier: false
```

</back>
