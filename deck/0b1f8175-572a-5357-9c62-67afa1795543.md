  verdict: CONTRADICTED
  explanation: "The answer states that sources cannot be configured in dbt_project.yml or using config() blocks, but the reference explicitly states that sources can be configured both in .yml files with config: blocks and in dbt_project.yml, directly contradicting this claim."

<front>

Where must dbt Sources be defined and configured within a dbt project?

<back>

Sources must be declared in `.yml` files located within the `models/` directory (or paths defined in `model-paths`). Unlike models, sources cannot be configured in `dbt_project.yml` or using `config()` blocks.
