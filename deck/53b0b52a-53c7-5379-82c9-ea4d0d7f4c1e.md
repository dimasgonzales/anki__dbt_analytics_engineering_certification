<front>

You created a macro that calculates a list of years, but when you call it via `{% set years = my_macro() %}`, the `years` variable is empty and the years are printed into the SQL file as text. What is wrong?

</front>

<back>

The macro is printing output instead of returning it.

You likely used `{{ year_list }}` inside the macro, which outputs text. You must change the macro to explicitly use `{{ return(year_list) }}` so the calling model receives the list object.
