  explanation: "The reference text discusses breaking CTEs into separate models, grouping models in directories, and porting CTEs to individual data models, but it does not mention or specify the four components of a Standardized CTE structure (Import CTEs, Logical CTEs, Final CTE, Final Select) as described in the answer. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to verify the accuracy of the answer based on the provided text."

1. **Import CTEs**: Simple selects from sources or refs.
2. **Logical CTEs**: Where transformations and logic happen.
3. **Final CTE**: Joins the logical components.
4. **Final Select**: A simple `select * from final`.
