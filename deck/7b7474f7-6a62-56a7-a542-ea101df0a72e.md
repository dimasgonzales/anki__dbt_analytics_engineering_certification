What is the primary difference between 'Visualizing' and 'Orchestrating' exposures in dbt Cloud?

<back>

**Visualizing** adds downstream assets (like dashboards) to the Lineage Graph and Catalog for impact analysis and documentation. **Orchestrating** uses the dbt Scheduler to actively trigger updates or refreshes for those external assets (like Tableau extracts) after a dbt job completes.
