  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer accurately describes the primary difference: Visualizing exposures focuses on understanding lineage and usage for analysis and documentation, while orchestrating exposures involves using the dbt scheduler to refresh external assets during jobs. The reference text supports this with specific descriptions for both."
  citation:
    quote: "Set up and visualize downstream exposures automatically from dashboards to understand how models are used in downstream tools for a richer downstream lineage. Orchestrate downstream exposures – Proactively refreshes the underlying data sources (like Tableau extracts) using the dbt scheduler during scheduled dbt jobs."

What is the primary difference between 'Visualizing' and 'Orchestrating' exposures in dbt Cloud?

<back>

**Visualizing** adds downstream assets (like dashboards) to the Lineage Graph and Catalog for impact analysis and documentation. **Orchestrating** uses the dbt Scheduler to actively trigger updates or refreshes for those external assets (like Tableau extracts) after a dbt job completes.
