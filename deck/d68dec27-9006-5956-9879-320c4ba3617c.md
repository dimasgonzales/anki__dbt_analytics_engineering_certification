<front>

A model is failing with a SQL syntax error, but the source code uses complex macros making it hard to spot the bug. How can you inspect the exact SQL query dbt is trying to run?

<back>

Inspect the file in the `target/compiled/` directory corresponding to that model.

This file shows the pure SQL after all macros and Jinja have been rendered, allowing you to identify syntax errors in the generated code.
