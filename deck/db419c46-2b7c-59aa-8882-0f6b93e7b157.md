<front>

You have configured `store_failures: true` for a generic test. After a failure, how can you programmatically find the database table where the failing records were saved?

</front>

<back>

Read the `relation_name` field in `run_results.json`.

When failures are stored, this field contains the fully qualified name of the audit table in the database.

Example:
```json
"relation_name": "\"analytics\".\"dbt_test_audit\".\"unique_cust_id\""
```

</back>
