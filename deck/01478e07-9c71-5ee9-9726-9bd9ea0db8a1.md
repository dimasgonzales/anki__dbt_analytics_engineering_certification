<front>

How do you assign dbt resources to a group project-wide versus individually, and what key is used in `dbt_project.yml`?

<back>

You can assign resources project-wide in `dbt_project.yml` or individually in SQL config blocks/YAML properties. In `dbt_project.yml`, you must use the `+group` key.

Example `dbt_project.yml`:
```yaml
models:
  my_project:
    +group: marketing
```
