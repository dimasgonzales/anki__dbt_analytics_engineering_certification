  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly states that analysis files are compiled but not executed, which supports the claim that they are never materialized in the database. For models, the text discusses materializations and how models are built, implying they are materialized when executed, aligning with the answer's distinction."

    quote: "Any .sql files found in the analyses/ directory of a dbt project will be compiled, but not executed."

<front>

What is the primary difference between a file in the `models/` directory and a file in the `analyses/` directory regarding database materialization?

<back>

Files in `models/` are materialized (created as tables, views, etc.) in the database when `dbt run` is executed. Files in `analyses/` are **never** materialized in the database; they are only compiled to resolve Jinja logic.
