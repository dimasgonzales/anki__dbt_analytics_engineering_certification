What is the primary difference between a file in the `models/` directory and a file in the `analyses/` directory regarding database materialization?

Files in `models/` are materialized (created as tables, views, etc.) in the database when `dbt run` is executed. Files in `analyses/` are **never** materialized in the database; they are only compiled to resolve Jinja logic.
