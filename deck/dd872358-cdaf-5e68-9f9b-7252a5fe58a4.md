<front>

Your CI/CD pipeline takes 45 minutes to run, but a syntax error in an early model causes the whole run to fail eventually. How can you configure the run to stop immediately upon the first error to save compute resources?

Use the `--fail-fast` flag.

Command:
```bash
dbt run --fail-fast
```
This stops execution immediately when any resource fails, rather than continuing to build independent paths.
