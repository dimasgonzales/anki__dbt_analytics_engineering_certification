<front>

You have the following configuration for `dim_customers`:
```yaml
models:
  - name: dim_customers
    latest_version: 1
    versions:
      - v: 2
      - v: 1
```
Which version will be used by a downstream model containing `select * from {{ ref('dim_customers') }}`?

</front>

Version 1.

Because the `ref` function is unpinned (no version specified) and `latest_version` is explicitly set to `1`, dbt resolves the reference to version 1, even though a newer version (v2) exists.
