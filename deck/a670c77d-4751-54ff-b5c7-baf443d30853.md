<front>

You are viewing a model's documentation and need to verify if the table was successfully built in the last production run. Why is dbt Explorer preferred over standard dbt Docs for this task?

In standard dbt Docs, you would have to cross-reference the model description with separate orchestrator logs or `run_results.json`. In **dbt Explorer**, you can see a green 'Success' badge and the timestamp of the last run directly on the model page, eliminating the need to check external logs.
