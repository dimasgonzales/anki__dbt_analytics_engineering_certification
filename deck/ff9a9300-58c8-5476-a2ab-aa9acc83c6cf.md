How can you limit the number of failure results returned by a failed test? And why would you want to do this?

Using the `limit: n` attribute of the test's config block. This can save you some compute usage if you are testing, say, a 100k row table, but you just need to know about the first 100 failed rows, you don't need to spend the effort to capture the failures for (potentially) the other 99.99k rows.
