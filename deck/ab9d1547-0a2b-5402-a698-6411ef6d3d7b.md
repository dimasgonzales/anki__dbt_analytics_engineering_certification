<front>

You added `{{ debug() }}` to a model and ran the command below, but dbt did not pause. What is the likely cause?

```bash
dbt run --select my_model
```

</front>

<back>

You failed to set the environment variable required to trigger the debugger. You should run:

```bash
DBT_MACRO_DEBUGGING=1 dbt run --select my_model
```

</back>
