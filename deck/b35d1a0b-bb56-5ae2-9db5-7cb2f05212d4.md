  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that to change how dbt generates schema names globally, a macro named 'generate_schema_name' must be defined in the 'macros/' directory, which directly supports the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "copy the example code in the section [How does dbt generate a model's schema name](#how-does-dbt-generate-a-models-schema-name) into a file named `macros/generate_schema_name.sql` and make changes as necessary."

<front>

What specific macro name must you define to change how dbt generates schema names globally?

<back>

You must define a macro named `generate_schema_name` in your `macros/` directory.

dbt looks specifically for this macro name to override its built-in default schema generation logic.
