<front>

When using the `merge` strategy in an incremental model, what configuration allows you to prevent specific columns (like `created_at`) from being overwritten?

<back>

The `merge_exclude_columns` configuration.
This accepts a list of column names. During the merge operation, dbt will update all columns *except* those specified in this list when a unique key match is found.
```yaml
merge_exclude_columns = ['created_at']
```
