  explanation: "The reference text explicitly describes and demonstrates that to configure models in a specific directory in `dbt_project.yml`, the structure must use the 'models:' key, followed by the project name, and then the directory name, which directly matches the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "To configure models in your `dbt_project.yml` file, use the `models:` configuration option. Be sure to namespace your configurations to your project (shown below):  models:   dbt_labs:     events:       +enabled: true       +materialized: view"

What is the required YAML structure in `dbt_project.yml` to apply configurations to a specific directory of models?

You must nest configurations under the `models:` key, followed by the **project name**, and then the **directory name**.

Example:
```yaml
models:
  my_project_name:
    marketing: 
      +materialized: view
```

</back>
