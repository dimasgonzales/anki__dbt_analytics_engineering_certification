What is the required YAML structure in `dbt_project.yml` to apply configurations to a specific directory of models?

You must nest configurations under the `models:` key, followed by the **project name**, and then the **directory name**.

Example:
```yaml
models:
  my_project_name:
    marketing: 
      +materialized: view
```

</back>
