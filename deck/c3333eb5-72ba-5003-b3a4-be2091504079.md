  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer is supported by the reference text. It correctly states that `log` with `info=False` writes to the log file only (as per the log function reference), and with `info=True` writes to both log and stdout, making it equivalent to `print` in output destinations. The reference from the print function confirms that with `QUIET=True`, non-error logs are silenced while `print` messages still appear in stdout, which aligns with the answer's third point."

    quote: "When used in conjunction with the `QUIET` global config, which suppresses non-error logs, you will only see error logs and the print messages in stdout."

What is the difference between the `log` and `print` functions?

<back>

- `log` writes to the log file, but *not* to stdout
- *unless* you pass `True` to the optional `info` parameter, in which case `log` is equivalent to `print`
- *unless* the global config `QUIET` is set to `True`, in which case `print` will still produce output but non-error `log` messages will be silenced
