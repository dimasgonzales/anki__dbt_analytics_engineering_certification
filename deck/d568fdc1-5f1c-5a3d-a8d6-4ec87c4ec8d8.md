  explanation: "The reference text explicitly shows the command 'dbt test --select \"source:*\"' to run tests on all sources, and explains that tests can be selected indirectly via their parent nodes, such as sources, supporting the answer's correctness."

<front>

Which selector syntax allows you to specifically target and run tests on all defined Sources in your project?

Use the `source:*` selector:

```bash
dbt test --select "source:*"
```
This selects all source nodes and, via indirect selection, runs the tests attached to them.
