<front>

You want to leave a note for other developers explaining a complex piece of logic, but you do not want this note to be visible in the query history of your data warehouse. Which syntax should you use?

</front>

<back>

Use the **Jinja comment syntax**: `{# Your note here #}`.

Since dbt compiles Jinja before sending SQL to the warehouse, these comments are removed entirely from the generated code.
