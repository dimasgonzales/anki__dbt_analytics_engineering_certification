<front>

Which configuration keys in `dbt_project.yml` allow you to change the default directory locations for resources like models or seeds?

<back>

The `*-paths` configuration keys.

Common examples include:
```yaml
model-paths: ["models"]
seed-paths: ["seeds"]
test-paths: ["tests"]
macro-paths: ["macros"]
```
These tell dbt where to look for specific file types.
