  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly mentions that flags like `model-paths` in `dbt_project.yml` are used to specify directory locations for resources, supporting the Answer's claim about `*-paths` configuration keys."
  citation:
    quote: "Flags that tell dbt where to find project resources (for example, `model-paths`) are set in `dbt_project.yml`, but as a top-level key, outside the `flags` dictionary; these configs are expected to be fully static and never vary based on the command or execution environment."

<front>

Which configuration keys in `dbt_project.yml` allow you to change the default directory locations for resources like models or seeds?

The `*-paths` configuration keys.

Common examples include:
```yaml
model-paths: ["models"]
seed-paths: ["seeds"]
test-paths: ["tests"]
macro-paths: ["macros"]
```
These tell dbt where to look for specific file types.
