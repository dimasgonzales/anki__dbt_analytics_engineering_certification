  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that starting in version 1.3, dbt Core and dbt support Python models, and SQL is supported as the primary language for models, which directly supports the answer. It also confirms that transformations occur within the data warehouse, aligning with the additional context in the answer."

<front>

What languages are supported for defining models in dbt Core v1.3+ and dbt Cloud?

<back>

dbt supports **SQL** (`.sql` files) and **Python** (`.py` files).

Regardless of the language chosen, dbt compiles and executes these models as transformations directly within the data warehouse.
