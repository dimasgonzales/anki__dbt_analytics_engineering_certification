<front>

You are setting up a dbt Cloud project and want to list your internal package `my_org/finance_logic` in `dependencies.yml`. Is this supported if you are using the native private package feature?

Yes, this is supported.

Since native private packages do not rely on Jinja templating for credentials (authentication is handled internally by the platform), they are compatible with the static nature of `dependencies.yml`.
