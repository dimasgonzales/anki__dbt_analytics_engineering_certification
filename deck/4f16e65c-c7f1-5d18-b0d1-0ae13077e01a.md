<front>

You have configured a BigQuery source with `identifier: "events_*"` to capture sharded tables. How do you filter for tables created after January 1st, 2023, in your model SQL?

<back>

You filter using the `_table_suffix` pseudo-column in the `WHERE` clause.

```sql
select * from {{ source('ga', 'events') }}
where _table_suffix > '20230101'
```
