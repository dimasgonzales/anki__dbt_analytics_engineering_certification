What are the main differences between resource **configs** and resource **properties**?
</front>

- Properties are declared for resources one-by-one in `.yml` files. Configs can be defined there, nested under a `config` property. They can also be set one-by-one via a `config()` macro (right within `.sql` files), and for many resources at once in `dbt_project.yml.`
- Because configs can be set in multiple places, they are also applied hierarchically. An individual resource might inherit or override configs set elsewhere.
- You can select resources based on their config values using the `config:` selection method, but not the values of non-config properties

A rule of thumb: properties declare things about your project resources; configs go the extra step of telling dbt how to build those resources in your warehouse. This is generally true, but not always, so it's always good to check!
