<front>

You have written a Python script in the `models/` directory, but dbt returns an error saying it cannot find the dataframe to materialize. The code performs calculations but ends with `print(df)`. How would you fix this?

<back>

Replace `print(df)` with `return df`. dbt Python models require the `model()` function to explicitly return a DataFrame object so the adapter can materialize it as a table or view in the data warehouse.
