<front>

A dbt Python model fails with the error: "KeyError: 'model'". You check your code and see:

```python
def run_transformation(dbt, session):
    df = dbt.ref("source_table")
    return df
```

What is the cause of this error?

<back>

The function defining the model logic is named incorrectly. dbt specifically looks for a function named `model`. You must rename `run_transformation` to `model` for dbt to execute the file.
