<front>

A downstream analyst attempts to `ref()` your `fct_orders` model from a separate project, but they receive a compilation error stating the model is not found or accessible. What is the most likely configuration issue?

</front>

<back>

The `fct_orders` model likely lacks the `access: public` configuration. By default, models are `protected` and cannot be seen by other projects in the mesh.

Fix:
```yaml
models:
  - name: fct_orders
    access: public
```

</back>
