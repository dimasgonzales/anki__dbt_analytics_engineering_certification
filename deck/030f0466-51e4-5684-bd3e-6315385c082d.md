<front>

You are loading a seed file containing zip codes (e.g., '01234'), but dbt is loading them as integers (e.g., '1234'). How do you fix this?

<back>

You must explicitly configure the column type to a string format to prevent integer inference. Use the `+column_types` config:
```yaml
+column_types:
  zipcode: varchar(5)
```

</back>
