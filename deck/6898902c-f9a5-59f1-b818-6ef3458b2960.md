<front>

During a `dbt build`, a `not_null` test on `order_id` fails. You want to see a sample of the records where `order_id` is null. How would you accomplish this?

</front>

<back>

Identify the test name from the output and run `dbt show` on that specific node. This runs the test query, which filters for the invalid rows (nulls).

```bash
dbt show --select not_null_orders_order_id
```

</back>
