<front>

What are the three primary use cases where dbt recommends using Python models over SQL models?

<back>

1. **Machine Learning**: Training or deploying models.
2. **Complex Math/Stats**: Logic difficult to express in SQL.
3. **General Purpose**: Using Python libraries (e.g., `dateutil`) for complex parsing or data manipulation.
