<front>

A developer reports a `DbtReferenceError` stating "node model.sales_report attempted to reference node model.int_commissions". The `int_commissions` model exists and compiles. What is the likely cause?

</front>

<back>

The `int_commissions` model is likely configured with `access: private` inside a specific group (e.g., 'finance'), and `sales_report` belongs to a different group (or no group). Cross-group references to private models are forbidden.
