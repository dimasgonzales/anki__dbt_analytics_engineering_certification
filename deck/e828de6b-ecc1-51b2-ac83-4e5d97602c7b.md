Your CI pipeline is taking too long because it rebuilds the entire warehouse on every Pull Request. How can you configure the `dbt build` command to only process changes and their downstream impacts?

Use the `--select` flag with the modified state selector.

Command:
```bash
dbt build --select state:modified+ --defer --state path/to/prod_artifacts
```
This minimizes runtime and compute costs by only building necessary models.
