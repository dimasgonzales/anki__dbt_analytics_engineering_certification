  explanation: "The reference text describes the general role of optimization and planning in translating logical to physical plans for efficient execution, but it does not explicitly mention 'table statistics' or specific execution details such as 'reordering joins' or 'choosing between index scans and sequential scans' to verify those parts of the answer."

    quote: "Layering in the knowledge of the physical characteristics of the objects referenced in a query to ensure efficient execution is the job of the optimization and planning stage."

<front>

What is the specific role of a database optimizer when translating a Logical Plan to a Physical Plan?

</front>

<back>

The optimizer determines the most efficient **Physical Plan** (how to execute) based on the **Logical Plan** (what to execute). It uses table statistics to decide on execution details, such as reordering joins or choosing between index scans and sequential scans to minimize cost.
