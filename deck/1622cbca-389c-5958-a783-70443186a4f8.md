  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer correctly describes the optimizer's role in determining an efficient physical plan based on the logical plan, which is supported by the reference text. However, the specific mention of using table statistics and techniques like reordering joins or choosing between index scans and sequential scans is not explicitly covered in the provided text, but it does not contradict it; the text emphasizes efficiency and considering physical characteristics, aligning with the general intent of the answer."

<front>

What is the specific role of a database optimizer when translating a Logical Plan to a Physical Plan?

</front>

<back>

The optimizer determines the most efficient **Physical Plan** (how to execute) based on the **Logical Plan** (what to execute). It uses table statistics to decide on execution details, such as reordering joins or choosing between index scans and sequential scans to minimize cost.
