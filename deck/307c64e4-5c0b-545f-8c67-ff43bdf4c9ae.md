  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly distinguishes between Jinja expressions and statements using the delimiters `{{ ... }}` and `{% ... %}`, which aligns with the Answer's description of their roles in dbt Jinja syntax."
  citation:
    quote: "Quoting in Jinja can take a while to get used to! The rule is that you're within a Jinja expression or statement (i.e. within `{% ... %}` or `{{ ... }}`), you'll need to use quotes for any arguments that are strings."

<front>

In dbt Jinja syntax, what is the difference between `{{ ... }}` and `{% ... %}`?

1. `{{ ... }}` is the **Expression** delimiter: It prints the result of a variable or function to the compiled SQL (e.g., `{{ ref('table') }}`).
2. `{% ... %}` is the **Statement** delimiter: It handles control flow logic like loops and conditionals but does not print text directly (e.g., `{% if ... %}`).
