<front>

You are integrating dbt with a third-party orchestration tool that expects the freshness results file to be located at `/tmp/dbt_results.json`. How do you achieve this?

Use the `--output` (or `-o`) flag when running the command to specify the custom file path.

Command:
```bash
dbt source freshness --output /tmp/dbt_results.json
```

</back>
