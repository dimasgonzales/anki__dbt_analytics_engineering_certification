<front>

You have run `dbt docs generate` in your local environment and confirmed the artifacts were created in the target folder. How do you view the resulting documentation site locally?

</front>

---

<back>

Run the following command:
```bash
dbt docs serve
```
This starts a local web server (usually on port 8080) that hosts the documentation site using the artifacts you just generated.
