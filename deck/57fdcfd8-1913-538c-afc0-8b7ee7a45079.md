  explanation: "The reference text only mentions 'dbt docs serve' as a subcommand but does not provide details on its functionality, such as starting a local web server or specifying port 8080. The text focuses on 'generate' and viewing documentation via dbt Cloud or IDE, offering no information to verify the answer's specific claims."

<front>

You have run `dbt docs generate` in your local environment and confirmed the artifacts were created in the target folder. How do you view the resulting documentation site locally?

<back>

Run the following command:
```bash
dbt docs serve
```
This starts a local web server (usually on port 8080) that hosts the documentation site using the artifacts you just generated.
