<front>

You are running a production pipeline using `dbt run --quiet` to minimize log volume, but you need to ensure a specific warning message from a custom macro is still visible to the engineers. How should you implement this?

<back>

Use the `{{ print() }}` function for the warning message. Since `print()` outputs bypass the `QUIET` configuration suppression, the message will remain visible in the logs even when verbose logging is disabled.

```bash
$ dbt run --quiet
# Custom print messages still appear here
```

</back>
