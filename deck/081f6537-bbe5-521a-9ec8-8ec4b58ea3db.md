  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly confirms that dbt CLI uses the profile name from dbt_project.yml to find a matching profile in profiles.yml, and the mention of 'target' variables implies the use of target-specific credentials within that profile, supporting the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "When you run dbt from the CLI, it reads your dbt_project.yml file to find the profile name, and then looks for a profile with the same name in your profiles.yml file."

How does dbt determine which connection credentials to use when running a project?

dbt looks at the `profile` key in the `dbt_project.yml` file and searches for an exact matching top-level key in your `profiles.yml` file. If the names match, dbt connects using the credentials defined in the `target` for that profile.
