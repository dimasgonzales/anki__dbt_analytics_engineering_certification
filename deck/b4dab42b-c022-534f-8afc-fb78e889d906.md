  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms the hierarchy of precedence for dbt global configurations (flags): CLI options have the highest priority, followed by environment variables, then dbt_project.yml, and finally internal defaults."
  citation:
    quote: "If you set the same flag in all three places, the CLI option will take precedence, followed by the environment variable, and finally, the value in `dbt_project.yml`. If you set the flag in none of those places, it will use the default value defined within dbt."

<front>

What is the hierarchy of precedence for dbt global configurations (flags), from highest to lowest priority?

</front>

<back>

1. **CLI options** (Highest)
2. **Environment Variables**
3. **`dbt_project.yml` configuration**
4. **Internal defaults** (Lowest)

The most specific setting (CLI) always overrides general project settings.
