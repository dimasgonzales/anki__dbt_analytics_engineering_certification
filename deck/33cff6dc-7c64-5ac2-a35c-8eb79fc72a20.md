<front>

You installed a utility package that defines a `ref` macro using `adapter.dispatch`, expecting it to change reference behavior globally. However, your models continue to use default dbt logic. What is the likely cause?

<back>

The package cannot override `ref` because core context methods are not dispatchable. To override `ref`, you must define the macro directly in your own project (not an installed package) so it masks the context property within your project's scope.
