<front>

You are migrating a legacy project to a dbt Mesh architecture. Upon adding `access: public` to your models, you encounter a `ValidationError`. How do you resolve this?

<back>

Verify and upgrade your dbt version. The `access` configuration is a newer feature associated with dbt Mesh. You must upgrade your environment (local CLI and Cloud) to a compatible version (e.g., v1.6+) to use this key.

```bash
dbt --version
```
