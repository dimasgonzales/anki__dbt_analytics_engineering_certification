  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly indicates that when Jinja is needed for dynamic values like environment variables, `packages.yml` should be used instead of `dependencies.yml`, supporting the claim that `dependencies.yml` does not support Jinja rendering and is for static configuration."
  citation:
    quote: "However, something to note is if your project's package specifications use Jinja, particularly for scenarios like adding an environment variable or a [Git token method](/docs/build/packages#git-token-method) in a private Git package specification, you should continue using the `packages.yml` file name."

What is a critical limitation of `dependencies.yml` compared to `packages.yml` regarding configuration syntax?

`dependencies.yml` does **not** support Jinja rendering. It is strictly for static configuration. If you need dynamic values, such as `{{ env_var(...) }}`, you must use `packages.yml`.
