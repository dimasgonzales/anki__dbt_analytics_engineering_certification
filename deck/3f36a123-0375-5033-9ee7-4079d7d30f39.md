How do you configure a model in an upstream project so it can be referenced by a downstream project in a dbt Mesh architecture?

You must configure the `access` property to `public` in the model's YAML configuration. This explicitly permits other projects to import and build upon that model.

```yaml
models:
  - name: dim_customers
    access: public
```
