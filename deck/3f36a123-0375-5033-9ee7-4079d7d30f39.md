  explanation: "The reference text does not contain information about configuring the 'access' property to 'public' for models in dbt Mesh. It discusses project dependencies, cross-project references using two-argument 'ref', and other configurations, but does not mention or support the specific YAML property 'access: public' as described in the answer."

<front>

How do you configure a model in an upstream project so it can be referenced by a downstream project in a dbt Mesh architecture?

You must configure the `access` property to `public` in the model's YAML configuration. This explicitly permits other projects to import and build upon that model.

```yaml
models:
  - name: dim_customers
    access: public
```

</back>
