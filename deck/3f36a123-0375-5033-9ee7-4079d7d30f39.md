  explanation: "The reference text mentions 'public models' and 'access modifiers' in the context of dbt Mesh architecture, indicating that models need to be public to be referenced by downstream projects. However, it does not explicitly state that this is configured using an `access` property in the model's YAML configuration as described in the answer. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to fully verify the answer."

How do you configure a model in an upstream project so it can be referenced by a downstream project in a dbt Mesh architecture?

You must configure the `access` property to `public` in the model's YAML configuration. This explicitly permits other projects to import and build upon that model.

```yaml
models:
  - name: dim_customers
    access: public
```

</back>
