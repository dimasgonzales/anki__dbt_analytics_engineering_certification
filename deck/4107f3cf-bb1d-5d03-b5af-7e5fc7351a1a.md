  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that if a selector doesn't match any nodes, it is not considered a failure, which supports the answer that the exit code is 0 (success) and not treated as an error."

<front>

What is the exit code of a dbt command if the selector provided (e.g., `--select`) matches zero nodes?

<back>

**Exit Code 0** (Success).

dbt does not treat an empty selection set as an error. It will display a message indicating no resources were found and complete the command successfully.
