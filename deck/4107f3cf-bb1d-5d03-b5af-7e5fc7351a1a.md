<front>

What is the exit code of a dbt command if the selector provided (e.g., `--select`) matches zero nodes?

<back>

**Exit Code 0** (Success).

dbt does not treat an empty selection set as an error. It will display a message indicating no resources were found and complete the command successfully.
