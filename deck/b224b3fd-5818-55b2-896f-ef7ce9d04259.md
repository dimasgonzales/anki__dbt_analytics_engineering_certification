<front>

You have added descriptions to your YAML files, but they are not appearing in the hosted documentation site. You ran `dbt run` successfully. What step did you miss?

<back>

`dbt run` only builds the data models in the warehouse; it does not regenerate the static HTML documentation files (`index.html`, `catalog.json`, `manifest.json`).
