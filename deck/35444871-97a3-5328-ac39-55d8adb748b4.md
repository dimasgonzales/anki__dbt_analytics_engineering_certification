<front>

You want to document a Tableau dashboard in your dbt DAG that reads from the `fct_orders` model. How would you configure this in a `.yml` file?

<back>

Define an `exposure` with the type `dashboard` and list `fct_orders` under the `depends_on` key.

```yaml
exposures:
  - name: sales_dashboard
    type: dashboard
    owner:
      name: Sales Team
    depends_on:
      - ref('fct_orders')
```

</back>
