<front>

What is the specific requirement for linking a YAML model property definition to its corresponding SQL file?

</front>

<back>

The `name` key in the YAML file must match the filename of the SQL model **exactly**, including case sensitivity.

If the file is named `my_model.sql`, the YAML must state:
```yaml
- name: my_model
```

</back>
