<front>

How must a composite primary key (spanning multiple columns) be defined in a dbt model's YAML configuration?

<back>

It must be defined at the **model level** under the `constraints` list, rather than under a specific column.
```yaml
models:
  - name: my_model
    constraints:
      - type: primary_key
        columns: [col_a, col_b]
```

</back>
