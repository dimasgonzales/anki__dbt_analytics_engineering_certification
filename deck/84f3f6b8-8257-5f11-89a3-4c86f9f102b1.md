  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that for constraints applying over multiple columns, the 'columns' property must be defined at the model level, which directly supports the answer's claim about composite primary keys."

How must a composite primary key (spanning multiple columns) be defined in a dbt model's YAML configuration?

<back>

It must be defined at the **model level** under the `constraints` list, rather than under a specific column.
```yaml
models:
  - name: my_model
    constraints:
      - type: primary_key
        columns: [col_a, col_b]
```

</back>
