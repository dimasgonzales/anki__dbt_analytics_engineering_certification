  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Answer is explicitly supported by the Reference Text, which states that custom generic tests in dbt are SQL queries that select failing records, and the test passes if no rows are returned and fails if rows are returned."
  citation:
    quote: "If the data test returns zero failing rows, it passes, and your assertion has been validated."

<front>

When writing the SQL logic for a custom generic test in dbt, how does the system determine if the test passes or fails?

<back>

dbt tests look for **anti-patterns** (failing records). The SQL query must be written to select the invalid rows.

- **Pass**: The query returns 0 rows.
- **Fail**: The query returns > 0 rows.
