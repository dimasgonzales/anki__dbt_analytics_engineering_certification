  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text provides YAML examples confirming that columns can have a 'config' property with 'tags' and 'meta', which supports the first part of the answer. However, there is no evidence in the text regarding whether columns inherit tags or meta from their parent resources, such as tables, so the second part of the answer is not addressed."

<front>

True or false: you can apply `tags` and `meta` configs to `columns`, even though columns are not truly resources the way that models, etc., are

<back>

True, but because they aren't full resources they don't inherit the tags or meta values from their parents (the tables).
