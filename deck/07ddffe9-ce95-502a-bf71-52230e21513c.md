  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The text confirms that tags and meta can be applied to columns, supporting the first part of the answer. However, it does not provide information about whether columns inherit these configs from their parents (tables), leaving the inheritance claim unverified."

<front>

True or false: you can apply `tags` and `meta` configs to `columns`, even though columns are not truly resources the way that models, etc., are

<back>

True, but because they aren't full resources they don't inherit the tags or meta values from their parents (the tables).
