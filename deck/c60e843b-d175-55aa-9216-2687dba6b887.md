  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that the ref function allows dbt to infer dependencies and ensure models are built in the correct order, which directly supports the answer's claim about its role in constructing a DAG for execution order."

<front>

What is the primary role of the `{{ ref() }}` function regarding dbt's execution order?

<back>

The `ref()` function tells dbt which models the current model depends on. dbt uses this information to construct the **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)**, ensuring that upstream dependencies are built before the models that reference them.
