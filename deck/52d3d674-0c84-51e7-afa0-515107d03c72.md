<front>

You need to validate a development model by connecting a BI tool (like Tableau or Looker) to your development schema. Should you use `state: modified` with `--defer` or `dbt clone`? Why?

<back>

You should use **`dbt clone`**.

External BI tools cannot utilize dbt's internal `defer` logic; they require physical tables or views to exist in the schema they are querying. `dbt clone` ensures these objects exist in your dev schema so the BI tool can read them.
