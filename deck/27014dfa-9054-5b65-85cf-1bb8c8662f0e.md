<front>

You defined a description in your `.yml` file containing a Markdown bulleted list, but in the dbt docs site, the list renders as a single blob of text. What is the likely configuration error?

<back>

You likely used the **folded style** (`>`) instead of the **literal style** (`|`).

To fix this, change the block indicator to `|`:
```yaml
description: |
  * Point A
  * Point B
```
