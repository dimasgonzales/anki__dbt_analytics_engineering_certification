<front>

A model is currently materialized as a `view`, but queries against it are too slow. You need to persist the data as a `table` to improve performance. How do you accomplish this without rewriting the SQL logic?

Update the materialization configuration key to `table`. This can be done in two ways:

1. In `dbt_project.yml`:
```yaml
models:
  +materialized: table
```
2. In the model's config block:
```sql
{{ config(materialized='table') }}
```

</back>
