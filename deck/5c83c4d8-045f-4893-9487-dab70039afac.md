<front>
What does the `dbt source freshness` command do?
</front>

---

<back>

This command queries all of your project's defined source tables and determines the "freshness" of those tables, based on the freshness configuration for each source (e.g. what timestamp column indicates data changes, how old does data need to be to trigger a warning or error, etc). If a source table is found to be "stale", dbt will exit with a non-zero error code. When the command completes, a freshness summary file will be placed in your target directory called `sources.json`.
  
  
As with most other commands, the sources checked can be filtered using dbt selection syntax.
