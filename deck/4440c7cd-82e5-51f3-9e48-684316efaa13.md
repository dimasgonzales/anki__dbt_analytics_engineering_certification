How does the `ref()` function behave when referencing a versioned model if the version argument is omitted?

It automatically resolves to the version declared as `latest_version` in the model's YAML configuration.

Example:
```sql
-- If latest_version: 2
select * from {{ ref('my_model') }} 
-- Compiles to analytics.my_model_v2
```

</back>
