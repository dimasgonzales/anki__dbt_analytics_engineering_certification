<front>

You have a model `stg_orders.sql` containing the following code:

```sql
select * from analytics.raw_orders
```

Why is this considered an anti-pattern and what is the consequence?

</front>

<back>

This hardcodes the schema `analytics`. 

**Consequence:** This breaks **environment isolation** (it will fail in dev/CI environments) and breaks the **DAG** (dbt cannot track the dependency). 

**Fix:** Use `{{ source('source_name', 'raw_orders') }}` or `{{ ref('raw_orders') }}`.
