  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text confirms that `insert_overwrite` is partition-based, overwrites entire partitions without using a `unique_key` for row matching, which differs from `merge` that uses a `unique_key` for row-level operations, supporting the answer's description."

How does the `insert_overwrite` strategy differ from `merge` regarding data replacement?

<back>

`insert_overwrite` is partition-based rather than row-based.
Instead of matching individual rows via a `unique_key`, it identifies which partitions (e.g., dates) exist in the new data and completely replaces those specific partitions in the destination table. It is essentially an atomic delete-and-insert at the partition level.
