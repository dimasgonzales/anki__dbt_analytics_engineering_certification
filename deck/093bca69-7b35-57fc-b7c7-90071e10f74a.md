How does the `insert_overwrite` strategy differ from `merge` regarding data replacement?

<back>

`insert_overwrite` is partition-based rather than row-based.
Instead of matching individual rows via a `unique_key`, it identifies which partitions (e.g., dates) exist in the new data and completely replaces those specific partitions in the destination table. It is essentially an atomic delete-and-insert at the partition level.
