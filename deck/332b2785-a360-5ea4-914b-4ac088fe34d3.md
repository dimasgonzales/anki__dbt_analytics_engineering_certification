What is the order of precedence for configurations applied to a generic test in dbt (from highest to lowest)?

<back>

The order of precedence is:
1. Specific instance properties in the schema YAML (e.g., inside the `data_tests` block).
2. The generic SQL definition's `config()` block.
3. The `dbt_project.yml` file configuration.
