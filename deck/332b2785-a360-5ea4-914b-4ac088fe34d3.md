  citation:
    quote: "e of a specific instance of a generic test, the test's `.yml` properties would take precedence over any values set in its generic SQL definition's `config()`, which in turn would take precedence over values set in `dbt_project.yml`."

What is the order of precedence for configurations applied to a generic test in dbt (from highest to lowest)?

<back>

The order of precedence is:
1. Specific instance properties in the schema YAML (e.g., inside the `data_tests` block).
2. The generic SQL definition's `config()` block.
3. The `dbt_project.yml` file configuration.
