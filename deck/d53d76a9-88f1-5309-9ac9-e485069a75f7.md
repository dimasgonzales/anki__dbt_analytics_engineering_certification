  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer accurately describes dbt seeds as CSV files for loading business-specific data, not raw data, which is explicitly supported by the reference text stating seeds should not be used for raw data and are best suited for business-specific logic."
  citation:
    quote: "Seeds should **not** be used to load raw data (for example, large CSV exports from a production database). Since seeds are version controlled, they are best suited to files that contain business-specific logic, for example a list of country codes or user IDs of employees."

<front>

What is the primary purpose of dbt seeds and what specific type of data are they designed to handle?

</front>

<back>

dbt seeds are CSV files located in the `seeds` directory intended to load static, business-specific data (like mapping tables or exclusion lists) into the data warehouse. They are not designed for raw data ingestion; instead, they allow you to version control small datasets that change infrequently alongside your SQL code.
