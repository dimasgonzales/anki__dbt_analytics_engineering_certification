What is the primary purpose of dbt seeds and what specific type of data are they designed to handle?

<back>

dbt seeds are CSV files located in the `seeds` directory intended to load static, business-specific data (like mapping tables or exclusion lists) into the data warehouse. They are not designed for raw data ingestion; instead, they allow you to version control small datasets that change infrequently alongside your SQL code.
