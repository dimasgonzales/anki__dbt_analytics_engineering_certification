<front>

You have modified the calculation logic for a `revenue` column in an incremental model. Why is a standard `dbt run` insufficient, and what action must you take?

</front>

<back>

A standard run only applies logic to new/incremental rows, leaving historical data with the old calculation. You must run a full refresh to drop and recreate the table, applying the new logic to all history.

Command:
```bash
dbt run --select my_model --full-refresh
```
