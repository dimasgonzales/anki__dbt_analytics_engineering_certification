<front>
how does "indirect selection" work for the `dbt test` command?
</front>

---

<back>

Selecting a set of models with the `dbt test` command will implicitly run any tests that depend on those models. E.g. `dbt test --select customers` will run tests that are defined on that model, without selecting the tests themselves directly.   
  
By default, indirect selection is **eager**, meaning *any* test downstream of the selected model(s) will be run, even if those tests also depend on other models that aren't selected. This behavior can be changed by setting the `--indirect-selection=cautious` option, which will prevent tests from running unless *all* of their model dependencies are included in the selection.  
  
Note that test *exclusion* is always greedy; if *any* parent is explicitly excluded, the test will be excluded as well.
