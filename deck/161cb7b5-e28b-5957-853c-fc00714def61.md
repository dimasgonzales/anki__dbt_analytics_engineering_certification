  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text discusses error handling, rerunning failed jobs, and state-based modifications in dbt, but it does not explicitly address the idempotency of dbt or the impact of running `dbt run` twice without changes to code or data. Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the answer's claim about no impact on the final dataset."

<front>

You mistakenly run `dbt run` twice in a row on your production environment without changing any code or underlying data. What is the impact on the final dataset?

<back>

There is no impact on the final dataset. Because dbt is idempotent, the second run will simply overwrite or merge the data to produce the exact same result as the first run, ensuring consistency regardless of repetition.
