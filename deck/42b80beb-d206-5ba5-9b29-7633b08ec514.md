<front>

Your team requires a setup with one deployment environment, one QA environment, and three distinct testing pipelines for different feature teams. How should you classify these environment types in dbt Cloud?

You should configure:
- 1 **Production** (Deployment)
- 1 **Staging** (QA)
- 3 **General** environments (Feature Teams)

You must use 'General' for the feature teams because you are limited to only one Staging and one Development environment per project.
