  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text discusses dbt project structure, staging models, and breaking up complex models, but does not mention the dbt_utils package, sharding, or the specific macros (get_relations_by_pattern and union_relations), so there is insufficient information to verify the answer."

<front>

Which two macros from the `dbt_utils` package are commonly used to combine multiple tables sharing a naming pattern (sharding) into a single model?

</front>

<back>

1. `get_relations_by_pattern`: Finds all tables matching a specific schema and name pattern.
2. `union_relations`: Generates the SQL to `UNION ALL` those relations together.

They are often used nested together.
