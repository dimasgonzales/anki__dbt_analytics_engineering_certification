  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that the `ha` config enables High Availability for Hive tables by creating a temporary table and swapping locations using Glue table versions, which matches the answer's description of avoiding downtime and the mechanism involved."
  citation:
    quote: "For less destructive behavior, you can use the `ha` config on your `table` materialized models. It leverages the table versions feature of the glue catalog, which creates a temporary table and swaps the target table to the location of the temporary table. This materialization is only available for `table_type=hive' and requires using unique locations."

It enables High Availability for Hive tables. Instead of dropping and recreating the table (which causes downtime), it creates a temporary table and atomically swaps the S3 location using Glue table versions.
