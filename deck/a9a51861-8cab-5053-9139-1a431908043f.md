<front>

You are building a new model `fct_orders`. It needs to select data from an upstream cleaning model named `stg_orders`. How do you reference this upstream dependency?

<back>

Use the `ref` function.

```sql
select *
from {{ ref('stg_orders') }}
```
This builds the lineage graph (DAG), ensuring dbt runs `stg_orders` before `fct_orders`.
