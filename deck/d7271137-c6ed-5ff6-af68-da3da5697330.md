  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that analysis files are compiled but not executed, directly supporting the answer's claim that Analyses are only compiled. While models are not explicitly described as materialized in the provided text, the contrast with analyses implies they are executed or built, as they are referenced by analyses using dbt functionality."
  citation:
    quote: "Any `.sql` files found in the `analyses/` directory of a dbt project will be compiled, but not executed."

<front>

What is the primary functional difference between a **Model** and an **Analysis** in dbt?

<back>

Models are **materialized** in the database (as tables, views, etc.), whereas Analyses are **only compiled**.

Files in the `analyses/` folder are processed by Jinja and rendered into pure SQL, but dbt does not execute the DDL to create them in the warehouse.
