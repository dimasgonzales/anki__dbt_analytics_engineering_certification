<front>

What is the primary functional difference between a **Model** and an **Analysis** in dbt?

</front>

<back>

Models are **materialized** in the database (as tables, views, etc.), whereas Analyses are **only compiled**.

Files in the `analyses/` folder are processed by Jinja and rendered into pure SQL, but dbt does not execute the DDL to create them in the warehouse.
