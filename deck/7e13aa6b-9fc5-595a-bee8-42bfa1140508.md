<front>

In dbt Cloud, into what type of database schema do Continuous Integration (CI) jobs build assets?

<back>

CI jobs build into a **temporary or ephemeral schema** (often named like `dbt_cloud_pr_<id>`) rather than the production schema. This isolates code changes to ensure that testing new code does not affect production data and allows the schema to be dropped automatically when the PR closes.
