  explanation: "The reference text discusses CI jobs, their setup, and integrations in dbt Cloud but does not mention the type of database schema into which CI jobs build assets, such as temporary or ephemeral schemas, or provide details on schema naming conventions like 'dbt_cloud_pr_<id>'. Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the answer."

<front>

In dbt Cloud, into what type of database schema do Continuous Integration (CI) jobs build assets?

</front>

<back>

CI jobs build into a **temporary or ephemeral schema** (often named like `dbt_cloud_pr_<id>`) rather than the production schema. This isolates code changes to ensure that testing new code does not affect production data and allows the schema to be dropped automatically when the PR closes.
