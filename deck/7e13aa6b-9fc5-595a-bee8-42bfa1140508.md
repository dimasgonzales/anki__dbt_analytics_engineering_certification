  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer claims that CI jobs build into a temporary or ephemeral schema, often named like `dbt_cloud_pr_<id>`, which aligns with the concept of a staging schema used for isolation during testing. The reference text confirms that CI jobs build and test in a 'staging schema' and that dbt deletes this schema after the PR is closed or merged, supporting the temporary nature described in the answer."

    quote: "dbt tracks the state of what’s running in your production environment so, when you run a CI job, only the modified data assets in your pull request (PR) and their downstream dependencies are built and tested in a staging schema."

<front>

In dbt Cloud, into what type of database schema do Continuous Integration (CI) jobs build assets?

<back>

CI jobs build into a **temporary or ephemeral schema** (often named like `dbt_cloud_pr_<id>`) rather than the production schema. This isolates code changes to ensure that testing new code does not affect production data and allows the schema to be dropped automatically when the PR closes.
