How does `dbt clone` assist in testing the `on_schema_change='fail'` configuration?

`dbt clone` establishes the existing table structure in the CI environment. This forces the subsequent run to attempt an incremental update. If the schema has changed (e.g., a new column), the `on_schema_change='fail'` check will trigger. Without cloning, dbt would perform a full refresh, bypassing the schema drift check entirely.
