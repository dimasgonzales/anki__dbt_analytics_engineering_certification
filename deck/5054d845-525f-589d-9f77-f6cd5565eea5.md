  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Answer correctly explains that `dbt clone` helps test `on_schema_change='fail'` by ensuring the incremental model exists in the CI environment, forcing an incremental run instead of a full refresh. This allows schema drift checks to be triggered when a column is added. The reference text confirms that cloning pre-existing incremental models ensures the `is_incremental` flag is true, enabling the schema change check to fail as it would in production."

    quote: "Because of your first clone step, the incremental models already exist in the PR-specific schema when you first execute the command `dbt build --select state:modified+` so the `is_incremental` flag will be `true`."

How does `dbt clone` assist in testing the `on_schema_change='fail'` configuration?

`dbt clone` establishes the existing table structure in the CI environment. This forces the subsequent run to attempt an incremental update. If the schema has changed (e.g., a new column), the `on_schema_change='fail'` check will trigger. Without cloning, dbt would perform a full refresh, bypassing the schema drift check entirely.
