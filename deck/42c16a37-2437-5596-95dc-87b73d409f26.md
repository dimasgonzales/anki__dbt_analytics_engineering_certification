What does the **`version`** field do in `dbt_project.yml` vs. in property YAML files?

<back>

The **`version`** field's purpose depends on its location:

* **In `dbt_project.yml`:**
    * It defines the version of your dbt **project** (not the runtime version).
    * It is **optional** starting in dbt v1.5.
    * It is used by dbt, for example, in package dependency management.

* **In property YAML files (e.g., `schema.yml`):**
    * It is a control tag for how dbt processes the properties file.
    * The only supported value is **`2`**.
