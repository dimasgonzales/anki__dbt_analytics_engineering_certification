  verdict: CONTRADICTED
  explanation: "The answer incorrectly states that the version field in dbt_project.yml is a required field that documents the intended dbt version; however, the reference text indicates it is optional from dbt version 1.5 and represents the version of the dbt project, not the dbt runtime version."

What does the **version** field do in dbt\_project.yml vs in property YAML files?

In **dbt\_project.yml**, "version" is a required field that documents the intended dbt version your project should be run on. However, this field currently is **not used** by dbt, it is for human documentation only. Enforcing a dbt version can only be done using the **require-dbt-version** option.  
  
In property YAML files, "version" is a control tag that informs how dbt processes property files. Currently, the only accepted/supported version is **2**.
