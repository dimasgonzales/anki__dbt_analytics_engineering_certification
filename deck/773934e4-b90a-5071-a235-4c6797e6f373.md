<front>

You run a unique test with the following configuration:
```yaml
severity: error
error_if: ">100"
warn_if: ">10"
```
The test finds 50 failing rows. What is the outcome?

</front>

---

<back>

**Warning**.

The row count (50) is not `>100` (so it is not an Error), but it is `>10` (so it triggers the Warning).
