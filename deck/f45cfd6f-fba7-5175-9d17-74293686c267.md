<front>

A pipeline fails with the error: `Snapshot target is not a snapshot table (missing dbt_scd_id, dbt_valid_from, dbt_valid_to)`. What does this indicate about the existing table in the warehouse?

<back>

This indicates that a table exists with the snapshot's name, but it was likely created as a standard table (or view) rather than via the `dbt snapshot` command.

Because the table lacks the required SCD meta-columns, dbt cannot perform the necessary merge/insert operations to track history.
