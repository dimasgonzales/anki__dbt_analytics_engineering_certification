  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that configurations in dbt_project.yml can be applied hierarchically to directories of models, as shown in examples and explained in the text, which directly supports the answer."

How does the directory structure of the `models/` folder relate to configuration application in `dbt_project.yml`?

The directory structure allows you to apply configurations hierarchically to groups of models in `dbt_project.yml`. 

For example, you can set all models inside a `marts/` folder to be tables without configuring each file individually:
```yaml
models:
  my_project:
    marts:
      +materialized: table
```
