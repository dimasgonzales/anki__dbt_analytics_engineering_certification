  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that a dbt hook, such as a pre_hook, can be used to set session properties for a specific dbt model, directly supporting the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "However, to temporarily adjust these session properties for a specific dbt model or group of models, you can use a [dbt hook](/reference/resource-configs/pre-hook-post-hook) to set session properties on a specific dbt model. For example: `{{ config( pre_hook=\"set session query_max_run_time='10m'\" ) }}`"

What is the recommended way to set database-specific session properties, such as query timeouts or memory limits, for a specific dbt model?

Use a `pre_hook` configuration. This executes a SQL statement before the model logic runs, allowing you to alter the session environment for the duration of that model run.
