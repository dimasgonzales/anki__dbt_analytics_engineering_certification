  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly defines actor_type as indicating whether an action was done by a user or an API request, which directly supports the answer's distinction between User actions (performed by a person) and Service actions (programmatic, via API request, with Service Token likely encompassed under API requests)."
