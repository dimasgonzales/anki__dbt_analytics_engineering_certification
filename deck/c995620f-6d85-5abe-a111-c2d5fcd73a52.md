<front>

Why might a dbt project fail to parse valid configuration keys like `access` or `contract` even if the syntax is correct?

The installed version of dbt Core is likely outdated. Advanced features are tied to specific minor versions (e.g., v1.5+ or v1.6+). Using configuration keys that do not exist in the active version will result in parsing or validation errors.
