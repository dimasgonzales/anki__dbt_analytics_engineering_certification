  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text includes a debugging tip that explicitly advises checking the dbt version when configuration keys cause errors, supporting the answer's claim that outdated versions can lead to parsing failures for advanced features."

    quote: "If you're using a key that is valid according to the documentation, check that you're using the latest version of dbt with `dbt --version`."

<front>

Why might a dbt project fail to parse valid configuration keys like `access` or `contract` even if the syntax is correct?

<back>

The installed version of dbt Core is likely outdated. Advanced features are tied to specific minor versions (e.g., v1.5+ or v1.6+). Using configuration keys that do not exist in the active version will result in parsing or validation errors.
