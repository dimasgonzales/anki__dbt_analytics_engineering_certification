<front>

You are creating a dbt model for Redshift and want to distribute data based on the `session_id` column, but the model is currently defined as a view. How must you update the configuration?

</front>

<back>

You must change the materialization to `table` because views cannot have physical distribution styles. Then, set the `dist` key to the column name.

Configuration:
```sql
{{ config(
  materialized='table',
  dist='session_id'
) }}
```

</back>
