<front>

You have a CSV file containing a static list of 50 legacy 'internal test user' IDs that must be filtered out of all financial reporting models. How should you implement this in dbt?

</front>

---

<back>

Place the CSV file in the `seeds/` directory and run the `dbt seed` command to build it in the warehouse. In your models, use the `ref()` function to select from this seed and filter the data.

Example usage:
```sql
select * 
from {{ ref('orders') }}
where user_id not in (select user_id from {{ ref('test_user_exclusions') }})
```

</back>
