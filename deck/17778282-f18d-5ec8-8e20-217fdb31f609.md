<front>

You have identified a version mismatch in your `packages.yml` file and found the correct version on dbt Hub. What is the complete workflow to apply this fix?

</front>

<back>

1. Update the `version` string in `packages.yml` to match the version found on dbt Hub.
2. Run `dbt deps` in the command line to download the new package version.
3. (Optional) Run `dbt clean` before `dbt deps` if you suspect cached artifacts are causing issues.
