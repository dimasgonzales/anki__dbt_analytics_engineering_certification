<front>

Given the following `dbt_project.yml`, what schema will models in `models/marts/finance/` build into (assuming default schema generation)?

```yaml
models:
  my_project:
    marts:
      finance:
        +schema: finance
```

</front>

<back>

They will build into `<target_schema>_finance`.

The `+schema` config sets the custom schema name to 'finance', which dbt then concatenates with your target schema by default.
