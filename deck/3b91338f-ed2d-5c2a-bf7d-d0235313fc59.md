  explanation: "The reference text explicitly supports the description of the 'append' strategy as adding new rows and being ideal for append-only data. However, it does not provide information on how the 'merge' strategy uses a 'unique_key' to identify existing records for updates, which is part of the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "Each run adds new rows to the existing table and never touches old rows. It's ideal for append-only data (e.g. logs or transactions that never change after insertion)."

What are the differences between the `append` and `merge` incremental strategies in dbt?

<back>

`append` simply adds new rows to the destination table and is best for logs where data never changes. `merge` checks for existing records using a `unique_key` to update them (upsert) while inserting new records, ensuring the table reflects the latest state.
