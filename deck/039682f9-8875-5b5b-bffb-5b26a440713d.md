<front>

Which operator must be used to concatenate strings and variables inside a Jinja `print()` statement?

</front>

---

<back>

The tilde operator (`~`) must be used. Unlike Python which uses `+`, Jinja uses `~` to convert operands to strings and concatenate them.

Example:
```jinja
{{ print('Table: ' ~ table_name) }}
```
