  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text mentions 'run results' and artifacts produced by dbt run, which may relate to `run_results.json`, but does not explicitly name `run_results.json` or `manifest.json`, nor confirm they are the two most critical artifacts for programmatically analyzing run outcomes and structure. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to support or contradict the answer."

In dbt Core, which two JSON artifacts are most critical for programmatically analyzing the outcome and structure of a completed run?

</front>

1. `run_results.json`: Contains the status (pass/fail), execution time, and error messages for every node in the run.
2. `manifest.json`: Contains the full project graph, configuration, and metadata allowing you to map results back to model definitions.
