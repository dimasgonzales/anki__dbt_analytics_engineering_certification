  explanation: "The reference text does not contain information about the execution order of multiple Deploy jobs triggered simultaneously in dbt Cloud. It discusses environment types (e.g., production, staging), settings (e.g., dbt version, threads), and setup steps, but does not address job scheduling, queuing, or sequential execution mechanisms for production jobs."

<front>

How does dbt Cloud manage the execution order when multiple Deploy jobs targeting the production environment are triggered simultaneously?

<back>

dbt Cloud enforces **sequential execution** for production Deploy jobs. If multiple jobs are triggered, they are placed in a 'Queued' state and run one after another to prevent race conditions or collisions on the underlying DAG.
