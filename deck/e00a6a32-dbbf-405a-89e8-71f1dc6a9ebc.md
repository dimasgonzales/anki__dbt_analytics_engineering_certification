In dbt Cloud, what additional set-up is needed for a "slim CI"-style job beyond just appending `--select state:modified+` to any commands?

The "Defer to a previous run state?" option needs to be set to another job whose most recent run you would like to "inherit" data from for all DAG nodes that are *not* being rebuilt in the slim CI build (most often this can just be your main production build job).
