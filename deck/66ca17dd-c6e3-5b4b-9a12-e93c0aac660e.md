<front>

What is the rationale behind starting some yaml keys with a "+" prefix in dbt configuration yaml (e.g. `+materialized: view`)?

It is used to help disambiguate between resource path keys and config keys, especially in the `dbt_project.yml` file (for any files that use `config-version: 2`). For example, in:  
```
models:
+materialized: view
jaffle\_shop:
marts:
+materialized: table
```  
`+materialized` is a "config" key, while `jaffle_shop` is a resource path key (all child attributes of `jaffle_shop` apply to the `jaffle_shop` schema). The plus sign not only helps to call out this difference, it is *required* in cases where a resource path name overlaps with a config key (e.g. if we had a schema that was also called `materialized` for some reason).
