<front>

You are migrating a dbt project to Materialize and find models configured with `materialized='incremental'`. How should you update these configurations?

</front>

<back>

You should change the configuration to `materialized='materializedview'` (or `table`).

Since Materialize processes data via streaming, standard incremental logic is unnecessary. The `materializedview` strategy ensures the data is always current.

```sql
{{ config(materialized='materializedview') }}
```

</back>
