<front>

You are auditing security roles and notice a user has 'Write' access to the Production environment. What specific actions does this allow them to perform regarding jobs?

</front>

<back>

Because dbt Cloud permissions do not separate resource actions, this user can:
1. **Create** new jobs
2. **Edit** existing job definitions (schedules, commands)
3. **Trigger** runs for existing jobs

You cannot isolate 'triggering' from 'editing' within the environment.
