<front>

You want to standardize your CI pipeline so that `dbt build --defer` always looks in `mnt/artifacts/`. You add `state: 'mnt/artifacts/'` to your `dbt_project.yml` flags, but dbt ignores it. Why?

<back>

Runtime paths like `state` and `log-path` are **restricted** from `dbt_project.yml`.

Because these paths depend on where the command is actually running (the runtime environment), dbt requires you to set them via Environment Variables (e.g., `DBT_STATE`) or CLI flags.
