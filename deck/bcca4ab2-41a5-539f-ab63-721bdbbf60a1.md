claim_meta:
  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly advises reordering columns in the schema to place high-cardinality query predicates to the left of the 32nd ordinal position for improved performance through file-level statistics, which directly supports the answer's claim about ordinal position and file pruning."

<front>

Why does the ordinal position of columns in a `SELECT` statement matter for performance in certain file formats (like Delta Lake or Parquet)?

<back>

Some query engines only collect statistics for file pruning on the first N columns (often the first 32). Placing high-cardinality columns frequently used in filters (like IDs or Timestamps) at the beginning of the schema ensures the engine can effectively skip files during scans.
