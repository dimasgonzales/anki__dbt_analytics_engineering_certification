<front>

You have written a complex SQL query for a one-off audit that you want version controlled and compiled by dbt, but you do **not** want it created as a table or view in your warehouse. Where should you save this file?

</front>

<back>

In the `analyses/` directory (or the directory defined in `analysis-paths`).

dbt will compile the code (resolving `{{ ref() }}` and macros) so you can copy-paste the executable SQL, but it will not run against the database during `dbt run`.
