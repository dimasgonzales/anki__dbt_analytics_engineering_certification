<front>

You need to generate the initial `schema.yml` file structure for the `orders` and `customers` models using the `dbt-codegen` package without writing it manually. What command would you run?

<back>

You would use `run-operation` to execute the `generate_model_yaml` macro, passing the model names in the arguments.

Command:
```bash
dbt run-operation generate_model_yaml --args '{"model_names": ["orders", "customers"]}'
```
