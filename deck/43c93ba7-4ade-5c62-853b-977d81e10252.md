  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly mentions Cross-Project Lineage as visualized by dbt Explorer when using dbt Mesh, but does not contain any information about Column-Level Lineage, which is also claimed in the answer. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to fully verify the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "* **Cross project lineage -** if you’re using the new [dbt Mesh](https://www.getdbt.com/product/dbt-mesh) architecture, you may trace your data back to the end of the DAG and find its source is not raw data, but in fact the output of another team’s dbt project!"

<front>

Beyond file-level dependencies defined by `ref()`, what two types of granular lineage does dbt Explorer visualize?

<back>

1. **Column-Level Lineage**: Traces specific fields/columns from the raw source through transformations to the final mart.
2. **Cross-Project Lineage**: Maps dependencies between different projects (enabled by dbt Mesh).
