<front>

In the context of custom materializations, what is the difference between `config.get()` and `config.require()`?

</front>

<back>

**`config.get('key', default)`** retrieves a configuration value if it exists, or uses a fallback value if provided, allowing for optional configs.

**`config.require('key')`** attempts to retrieve the value but raises a **compilation error** if the user has not defined that configuration key in their model.
