<front>

You need to configure a source table 'orders' to warn if data is older than 6 hours and fail if it is older than 12 hours. How would you configure this in YAML?

Add a `freshness` block to the source definition:
```yaml
sources:
  - name: raw
    tables:
      - name: orders
        freshness:
          warn_after: {count: 6, period: hour}
          error_after: {count: 12, period: hour}
```

</back>
