  explanation: "For `dbt clean`, the reference text indicates it deletes paths specified in the `clean-targets` list within `dbt_project.yml`, not specifically the `target/` and `dbt_packages/` directories. For `dbt deps`, no information is provided in the reference text regarding its function, such as downloading dependencies. Therefore, the answer cannot be verified due to insufficient evidence."

<back>

`dbt deps` downloads dependencies defined in `packages.yml` into the `dbt_packages/` folder. `dbt clean` deletes the `target/` and `dbt_packages/` directories. 

Example workflow:
```bash
dbt clean
dbt deps
```
