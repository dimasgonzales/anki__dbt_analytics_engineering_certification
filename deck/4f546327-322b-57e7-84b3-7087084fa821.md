<front>

A model fails during `dbt run` with a database syntax error regarding a `CREATE TABLE` statement. Which file path should you inspect to see the exact SQL executed against the warehouse?

</front>

<back>

You should inspect the file in `target/run/{project_name}/.../model.sql`.

This file contains the actual DDL wrapped around your query, allowing you to see the full context of the error, unlike `target/compiled` which only shows the select statement.
