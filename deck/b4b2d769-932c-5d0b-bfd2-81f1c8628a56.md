  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly supports both reasons in the answer: it confirms that ref() allows dbt to infer dependencies for correct build order and ensures environment-specific table selection, matching the points about DAG definition and environment isolation."
  citation:
    quote: "Using the `ref` function allows dbt to infer dependencies, ensuring that models are built in the correct order. It also ensures that your current model selects from upstream tables and views in the same environment that you're working in."

Why is it critical to use the `ref()` function instead of hardcoding table names (e.g., `schema.table`)?

<back>

Using `ref()` is critical for two reasons:
1. It manages environment isolation by interpolating the correct schema/table names for the active target.
2. It explicitly defines the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), ensuring dbt builds dependencies in the correct order.
