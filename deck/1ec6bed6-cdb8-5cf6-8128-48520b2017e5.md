<front>

How can you apply a generic test (like `unique`) to a calculated value without adding a physical column to the model?

You can pass a SQL expression to the `column_name` argument within the test configuration. This tells dbt to run the test against the expression result rather than a specific column name.

```yaml
data_tests:
  - unique:
      column_name: "field_a || field_b"
```

</back>
