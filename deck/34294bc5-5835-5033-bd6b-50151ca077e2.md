<front>

A developer writes python code inside the `def model(...)` function to assert that a column has no null values. Why is this considered a bad practice in dbt?

<back>

dbt separates transformation logic from validation logic. Assertions inside the model run during build time and are opaque to dbt's testing framework. Instead, you should configure a `not_null` test in the YAML configuration to run systematically after the model is built.
