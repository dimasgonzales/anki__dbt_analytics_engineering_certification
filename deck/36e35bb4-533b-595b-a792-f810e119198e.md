  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text discusses the purpose and use cases of `dbt clone`, such as testing code changes and preventing full-refresh builds with zero-copy cloning, but it does not specify what physical database object is created (e.g., a view, table, or other) or provide explicit details on storage consumption. The answer's claim about creating a view and not consuming significant storage is neither supported nor contradicted by the provided evidence."

<front>

You are using a Postgres data warehouse and run `dbt clone` to create a sandbox environment. What physical object is created, and does it consume significant additional storage?

<back>

dbt creates a **View** (specifically a pointer view defined as `select * from source_model`).

It does **not** consume significant additional storage because it does not duplicate the physical data; it only references the source table.
