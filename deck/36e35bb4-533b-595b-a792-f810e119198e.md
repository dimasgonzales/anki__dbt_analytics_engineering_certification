<front>

You are using a Postgres data warehouse and run `dbt clone` to create a sandbox environment. What physical object is created, and does it consume significant additional storage?

<back>

dbt creates a **View** (specifically a pointer view defined as `select * from source_model`).

It does **not** consume significant additional storage because it does not duplicate the physical data; it only references the source table.
