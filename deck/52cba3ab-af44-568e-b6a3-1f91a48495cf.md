<front>

You need to build a table with near real-time latency that handles complex upserts. You want to minimize code complexity and do not want to manually manage high-water marks or merge logic. Which materialization should you use?

<back>

Use a **Materialized View** (or Dynamic Table on Snowflake).

This shifts the complexity of the incremental update logic to the database platform, ensuring low latency without requiring manual `{{ is_incremental() }}` filter logic in your SQL.
