  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text discusses data health, freshness, and exposures, but does not mention the specific attributes 'maxLoadedAt', 'warnAfter', or 'errorAfter' as stated in the answer, so there is insufficient information to verify the claim."

<front>

Which attributes regarding data latency are associated with an exposure's parent sources?

Exposures can surface freshness data regarding their parent sources, specifically the `maxLoadedAt` timestamp and the configured `warnAfter` and `errorAfter` criteria. This links the freshness of raw data sources directly to the downstream consumption artifact.
