<front>

You are troubleshooting a complex macro where a variable `ratio` seems to be calculating incorrectly. How can you inspect the value of `ratio` exactly when it is defined during the run?

</front>

<back>

Place `{{ debug() }}` immediately after the variable definition in the macro code.

```jinja
{% set ratio = x / y %}
{{ debug() }}
```

This will pause execution so you can inspect the specific value of `ratio` in the console.
