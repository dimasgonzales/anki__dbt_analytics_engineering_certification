<front>

You have a legacy data model where duplicate records are known to exist, but you only want the pipeline to fail if there are more than 50 duplicates. How would you configure the `unique` test in YAML?

</front>

<back>

Configure `error_if` with the threshold `>50` and ensure the severity is set to error.

```yaml
data_tests:
  - unique:
      config:
        severity: error
        error_if: ">50"
```

</back>
