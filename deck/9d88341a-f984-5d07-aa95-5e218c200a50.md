<front>

You have updated the logic in `stg_payments` and need to run that model along with every model that relies on it downstream to check for breaking changes. Which command should you use?

<back>

You should use the `+` suffix operator.

```bash
dbt run --select stg_payments+
```

This builds `stg_payments` and cascades the update through the DAG to all descendant models (marts, reports, etc.).
