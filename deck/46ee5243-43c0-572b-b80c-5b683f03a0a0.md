<front>

A model is failing because it tries to query a table that hasn't been created yet, even though that table is defined in another model within your project. What is the likely cause and how do you fix it?

</front>

<back>

The failing model likely uses a hardcoded table name (e.g., `FROM analytics.stg_users`) instead of the `ref()` function. dbt cannot detect the dependency without `ref()`, so it may run the models out of order. Fix it by replacing the hardcoded name with `{{ ref('stg_users') }}`.
