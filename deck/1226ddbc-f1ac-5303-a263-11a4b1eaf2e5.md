Where is source freshness configured in a dbt project, and what are the two threshold keys available?

<back>

Freshness is configured in a `sources.yml` file under a `freshness:` block. The two keys are `warn_after` (logs a warning) and `error_after` (returns a failure status).

```yaml
freshness:
  warn_after: {count: 12, period: hour}
  error_after: {count: 24, period: hour}
```

</back>
