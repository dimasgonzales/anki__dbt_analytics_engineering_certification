<front>

If a dbt model has no specific configuration in the SQL file or `dbt_project.yml`, what materialization strategy does dbt use by default?

dbt defaults to `view`. This means no physical data is stored in the warehouse for that model, and the SQL logic is executed as a subquery or view definition whenever referenced.
