What is the difference between where `labels` and `policy_tags` are defined in dbt?

`labels` are defined in the model configuration block (SQL file or `dbt_project.yml`) and apply to the whole table/view. `policy_tags` are defined in the `schema.yml` file under specific columns and are used for Column-Level Security.
