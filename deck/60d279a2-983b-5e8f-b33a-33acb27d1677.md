  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text supports that 'labels' can be defined in model configuration or 'dbt_project.yml' and apply to tables/views, but it does not mention 'policy_tags', their definition in 'schema.yml', or column-level security, so the complete answer about the difference cannot be verified."
  citation:
    quote: "dbt supports the specification of BigQuery labels for the tables and views that it creates. These labels can be specified using the `labels` model config. The `labels` config can be provided in a model config, or in the `dbt_project.yml` file."

What is the difference between where `labels` and `policy_tags` are defined in dbt?

<back>

`labels` are defined in the model configuration block (SQL file or `dbt_project.yml`) and apply to the whole table/view. `policy_tags` are defined in the `schema.yml` file under specific columns and are used for Column-Level Security.
