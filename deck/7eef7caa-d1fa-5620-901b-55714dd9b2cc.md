<front>

You run `dbt run --select tag:daily` and the job finishes instantly with a 'Pass' status, but the logs show `0 of 0 OK`. What is the most likely cause?

The selector matched **no models**.

This is usually caused by a typo in the tag name or the tag not being applied to any enabled models. Because dbt returns success on empty sets, this is often a 'silent failure' in logic.
