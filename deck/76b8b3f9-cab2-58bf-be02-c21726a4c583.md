<front>

You have a standard definition for "Gross Revenue" that applies to 10 different models. To follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles, how should you implement this description in dbt?

</front>

<back>

Create a **docs block** in a `.md` file within your models directory. Define the definition once using `{% docs gross_rev_def %}` and reference it in every relevant `schema.yml` using `{{ doc('gross_rev_def') }}`.

This ensures that if the definition changes, you only update it in one place.
