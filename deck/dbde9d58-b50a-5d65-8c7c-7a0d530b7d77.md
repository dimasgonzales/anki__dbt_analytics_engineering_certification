<front>

Given the following `profiles.yml` configuration, where will models be built if you run `dbt run` without any flags?
```yaml
my_profile:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      schema: dbt_jdoe
    prod:
      schema: analytics
```

</front>

<back>

Models will be built in the `dbt_jdoe` schema. This is because the `target: dev` setting defines `dev` as the default execution environment when no specific target is provided in the CLI command.
