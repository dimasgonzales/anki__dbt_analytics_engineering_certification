<front>

You have a project-wide configuration setting all models to `materialized: view`. You need the `models/marts/finance` folder to build as tables without adding config blocks to every SQL file. How do you achieve this?

<back>

Define a nested configuration in `dbt_project.yml` specifically for the `finance` directory to override the higher-level default.

```yaml
models:
  my_project:
    +materialized: view
    marts:
      finance:
        +materialized: table
```

</back>
