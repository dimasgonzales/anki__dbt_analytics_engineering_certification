<front>

Is the `dbt test` command classified as a 'Read' or 'Write' command regarding CLI invocation limits?

</front>

<back>

`dbt test` is classified as a **Read** command (✅ parallel safe).

Even though it may log results to a file or terminal, it does not modify database objects in a way that requires an exclusive lock, allowing it to run in parallel with other read operations.
