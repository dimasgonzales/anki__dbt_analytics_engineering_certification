<front>

A specific table in your data warehouse requires running a `COLLECT STATISTICS` command every time it is recreated to ensure query performance. How would you automate this in dbt?

</front>

<back>

Define a `post_hook` in the model's configuration block. This ensures the command runs automatically every time dbt builds that specific model.

Example:
```sql
{{ config(
  post_hook="COLLECT STATISTICS ON {{ this }} ..."
) }}
```

</back>
