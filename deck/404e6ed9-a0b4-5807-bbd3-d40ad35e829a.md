  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that pre-hook and post-hook are configs applicable to models, seeds, and snapshots, which supports the core claim of the answer. The comparison to on-run-start and on-run-end project-level configs is not addressed in the provided text, but it does not contradict the answer."
