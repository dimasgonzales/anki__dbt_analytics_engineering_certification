<front>

You have changed a model's materialization from `view` to `table`. When you run `dbt run`, you encounter an error stating the object type cannot be changed (common in BigQuery). How do you resolve this?

</front>

<back>

Run the model with the `--full-refresh` flag:
```bash
dbt run --select model_name --full-refresh
```
This instructs dbt to drop the existing object entirely before creating the new one, which is often required when switching object types.
