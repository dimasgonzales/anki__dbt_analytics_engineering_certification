What is the primary trade-off when choosing a Materialized View over a traditional dbt Incremental model?

<back>

Materialized Views offer **platform-managed consistency** and simpler code (no `is_incremental` logic) but sacrifice **fine-grained control** over orchestration.

The data platform determines when and how to update the data, rather than dbt controlling the specific batch logic.
