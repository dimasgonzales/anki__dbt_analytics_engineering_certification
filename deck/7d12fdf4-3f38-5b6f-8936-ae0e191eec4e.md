  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer correctly identifies the trade-off of sacrificing fine-grained control over orchestration when using materialized views, as the data platform manages incremental logic instead of dbt, which is explicitly stated in the reference text."
  citation:
    quote: "The tradeoff (outside of any data platform specific ones) is that you will have less fine-grained control over the incremental logic and orchestration. This is because you are handing defining the logic of what and how to update the existing table over to the data platform to perform for you."

What is the primary trade-off when choosing a Materialized View over a traditional dbt Incremental model?

<back>

Materialized Views offer **platform-managed consistency** and simpler code (no `is_incremental` logic) but sacrifice **fine-grained control** over orchestration.

The data platform determines when and how to update the data, rather than dbt controlling the specific batch logic.
