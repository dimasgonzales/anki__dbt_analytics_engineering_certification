  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text does not mention the macro `{{ dbt.except() }}`. It discusses 'except' in contexts such as an argument for the 'star' macro to exclude columns, which is unrelated to the set operation functionality described in the answer. There is no evidence to verify the answer."

<front>

What is the function of the `{{ dbt.except() }}` macro?

</front>

---

<back>

It generates a SQL query that selects rows from one relation that do not exist in another. It abstracts the specific set operator syntax (e.g., handling `EXCEPT` vs `MINUS`) and is frequently used in audit helper models to find discrepancies between tables.
