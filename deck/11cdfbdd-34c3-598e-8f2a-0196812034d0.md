<front>

You accidentally ran a snapshot file as a standard model previously, creating a standard table named `dim_users_snapshot`. Now, `dbt snapshot` is failing. How do you resolve this?

<back>

You must manually drop the incorrect table in the data warehouse and re-run the snapshot command.

Steps:
1. Run `DROP TABLE schema.dim_users_snapshot` in your warehouse.
2. Run `dbt snapshot`.

This allows dbt to initialize the table correctly with the required SCD columns.
