<front>

Does the `dependencies.yml` file support Jinja rendering for conditional logic or variable expansion?

No. The `dependencies.yml` file is intended for static declarations only.

It does not support the Jinja-in-YAML context required for control structures (like `{% if %}`) or variable expansion.
