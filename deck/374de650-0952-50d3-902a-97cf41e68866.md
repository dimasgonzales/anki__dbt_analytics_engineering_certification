  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that the dependencies.yml file does not support Jinja, which aligns with the answer's claim that it is for static declarations only and lacks support for Jinja rendering, conditional logic, or variable expansion."

Does the `dependencies.yml` file support Jinja rendering for conditional logic or variable expansion?

<back>

No. The `dependencies.yml` file is intended for static declarations only.

It does not support the Jinja-in-YAML context required for control structures (like `{% if %}`) or variable expansion.
