  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that `error_if` and `warn_if` are the configuration properties used to define conditional failure thresholds for dbt tests, and that they accept conditional logic based on the number of failing rows, fully supporting the answer."

<back>

You can use `warn_if` and `error_if` configurations. These accept conditional logic (e.g., `>10`) to determine when a test result should trigger a warning or an error based on the number of failing rows returned.
