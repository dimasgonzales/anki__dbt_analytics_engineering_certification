<front>

You are writing a CI/CD script that pipes the output of `dbt list` into a text file, but the file currently contains unwanted timestamps and log messages. How do you fix this?

<back>

Add the `--quiet` flag to the command.

Example:
```bash
dbt list --quiet --select state:modified > models_to_run.txt
```
This ensures only the model names (clean output) are written to the file.
