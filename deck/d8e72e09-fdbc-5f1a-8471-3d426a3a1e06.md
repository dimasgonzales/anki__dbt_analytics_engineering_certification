<front>

Which property of an exposure is the *only* one that can be configured globally in `dbt_project.yml`, and where must all other properties be defined?

<back>

Only `+enabled` can be configured in `dbt_project.yml` for exposures. All other properties (like `owner`, `type`, `url`) must be defined directly in the specific `.yml` file where the exposure is declared.
