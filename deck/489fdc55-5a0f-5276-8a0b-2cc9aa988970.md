<front>

You have a model that filters data based on a `start_date` variable. You need to run this model for a specific backfill date different from the default defined in `dbt_project.yml`. How do you accomplish this?

<back>

Use the `--vars` flag with the `dbt run` command to override the variable value for that specific run.

Example:
```bash
dbt run --vars '{"start_date": "2020-01-01"}'
```
