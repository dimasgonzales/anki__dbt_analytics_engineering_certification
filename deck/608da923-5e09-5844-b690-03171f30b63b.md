<front>

In a CI pipeline checking `state:modified`, you add a new column `customer_segment` to the YAML contract of an existing versioned model. 

Will this trigger a breaking change error?

<back>

No. Adding a new column is considered an **additive change**. 

dbt allows contracts to evolve by adding fields, as this does not break existing downstream queries relying on the previous schema.
