  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text lists specific actions that constitute breaking changes, such as removing or modifying existing columns, and does not include adding new columns. This directly supports the answer that adding a new column is additive and does not trigger a breaking change error."

<front>

In a CI pipeline checking `state:modified`, you add a new column `customer_segment` to the YAML contract of an existing versioned model. 

Will this trigger a breaking change error?

<back>

No. Adding a new column is considered an **additive change**. 

dbt allows contracts to evolve by adding fields, as this does not break existing downstream queries relying on the previous schema.
