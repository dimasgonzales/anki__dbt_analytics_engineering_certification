<front>

You need to install the `dbt-labs/codegen` package only when the `target.name` is set to 'dev'. Which file should you use to define this dependency?

</front>

<back>

You must use `packages.yml`.

This file supports Jinja logic, allowing you to wrap the package definition in a conditional block:
```yaml
packages:
  {% if target.name == 'dev' %}
  - package: dbt-labs/codegen
    version: 0.9.0
  {% endif %}
```

</back>
