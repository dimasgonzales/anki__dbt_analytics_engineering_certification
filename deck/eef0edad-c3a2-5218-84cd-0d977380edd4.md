<front>

In dbt package development, what is the best practice for defining source schemas to ensure they are configurable by the end-user?

Use the `var()` function within the `schema` property of the source definition, providing a default value.

This allows end-users to override the schema location in their root `dbt_project.yml` without modifying the package code.

Example:
```yaml
schema: "{{ var('stripe_schema', 'raw_stripe') }}"
```
