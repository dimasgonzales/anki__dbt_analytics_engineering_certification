  explanation: "The Answer accurately states that dbt seed truncates the table by default, fails on schema changes like added or renamed columns, and requires the --full-refresh flag to drop and recreate the table, all of which are explicitly confirmed in the Reference Text."

<front>

What occurs by default when you run `dbt seed` on an existing table, and how does this change if the CSV schema has been modified?

By default, dbt **truncates** the table and inserts the new data. 

However, if columns are added or renamed, the standard command will fail. You must use `--full-refresh` to drop and recreate the table with the new schema.
