  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly supports the Answer by confirming that Jinja macros start with `{% macro %}` and end with `{% endmacro %}`, and are defined in `.sql` files typically in the `macros` directory. The text from python-models/rank_8.md directly describes the tags, and jinja-macros/index.md confirms the file location."

What are the required Jinja tags to start and end a macro definition block in a `.sql` file?

<back>

A macro is defined using the `{% macro macro_name(arguments) %}` tag to start and the `{% endmacro %}` tag to close the definition block. These are placed in `.sql` files typically located in the `macros` directory.
