<front>

You need to introduce a breaking change to `dim_products` but allow downstream teams 3 months to migrate. How should you configure the model YAML?

<back>

Define the new logic as a new version (e.g., v2) and set it as the `latest_version`. Keep the old logic as v1 and add a `deprecation_date` to warn users.

Example:
```yaml
models:
  - name: dim_products
    latest_version: 2
    versions:
      - v: 1
        deprecation_date: 2024-12-31
      - v: 2
```
