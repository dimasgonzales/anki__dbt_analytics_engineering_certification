  explanation: "The reference text confirms that 'dbt clean' removes artifacts, 'dbt deps' installs dependencies, and 'dbt debug' tests database connectivity, but it does not explicitly verify the specific details such as the directories 'target/' and 'dbt_packages/' for 'dbt clean' or 'packages.yml' for 'dbt deps', leaving the answer partially unverified."

1. `dbt clean`: Deletes the `target/` and `dbt_packages/` directories.
2. `dbt deps`: Installs dependencies listed in `packages.yml`.
3. `dbt debug`: Tests the connection profile and project configuration.
