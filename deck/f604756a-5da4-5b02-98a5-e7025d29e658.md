<front>

The 'Marketing Weekly' dashboard is showing outdated data. Assuming you have an exposure named `marketing_weekly` defined, how would you efficiently update only the models feeding this dashboard?

You should run dbt using the upstream selector for that specific exposure to avoid running the entire project.
```bash
dbt run -s +exposure:marketing_weekly
```
This targets only the specific chain of models required to freshen the data for that dashboard.
