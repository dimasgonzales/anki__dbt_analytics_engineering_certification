<front>

You have defined `dim_users` with versions `v1` and `v2` in your project. When you run `dbt run`, how are these materialized in the data warehouse?

<back>

They are materialized as two separate database objects (tables or views) with the version suffix appended to their names.

Example:
- `analytics.dim_users_v1`
- `analytics.dim_users_v2`

This allows both versions to exist simultaneously for zero-downtime migrations.
