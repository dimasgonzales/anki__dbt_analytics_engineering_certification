  explanation: "The Reference Text provides information on model versioning and materializations but does not explicitly state how versions are materialized when running `dbt run`. Specifically, it does not confirm or contradict that versions are materialized as separate database objects with version suffixes for zero-downtime migrations."

<front>

You have defined `dim_users` with versions `v1` and `v2` in your project. When you run `dbt run`, how are these materialized in the data warehouse?

<back>

They are materialized as two separate database objects (tables or views) with the version suffix appended to their names.

Example:
- `analytics.dim_users_v1`
- `analytics.dim_users_v2`

This allows both versions to exist simultaneously for zero-downtime migrations.
