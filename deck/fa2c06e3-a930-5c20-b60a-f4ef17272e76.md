  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly warns against using absolute paths for seed-paths and consistently shows examples with relative paths, directly supporting the answer's claim that paths must be relative and absolute paths are not supported."

<front>

<back>

Paths must be **relative** to the directory containing the `dbt_project.yml` file. Absolute paths (system-specific paths starting with `/` or drive letters) are not supported.
