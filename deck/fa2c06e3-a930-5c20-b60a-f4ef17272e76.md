<front>

What is the strict requirement regarding path formatting for `seed-paths` or `model-paths` in `dbt_project.yml`?

<back>

Paths must be **relative** to the directory containing the `dbt_project.yml` file. Absolute paths (system-specific paths starting with `/` or drive letters) are not supported.
