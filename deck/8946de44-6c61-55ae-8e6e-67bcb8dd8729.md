<front>

A seed file containing zip codes (e.g., "02134") is being loaded into the warehouse as the integer `2134`, stripping the leading zero. How do you fix this using `dbt_project.yml`?

<back>

Explicitly define the column type as a string/varchar in the project configuration to prevent it from being inferred as an integer.

```yaml
seeds:
  my_project:
    zip_codes:
      +column_types:
        zip_code: varchar(5)
```

</back>
