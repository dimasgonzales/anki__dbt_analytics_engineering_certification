What is the default `access` configuration for a dbt model, and what does this mean for cross-project references?

The default access is `protected`. This means the model can be referenced within its own project (and by installed packages), but it **cannot** be referenced by downstream projects in a dbt Mesh architecture. It is essentially private to the project.
