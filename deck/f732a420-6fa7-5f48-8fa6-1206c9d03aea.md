  explanation: "The reference text provides high-level information about the dbt build command, such as its functions and DAG order execution, but does not contain details on how test execution specifically affects downstream resources. There is no mention of tests blocking downstream resources, failure handling with severity settings, or behavior with multiple interrelated parents as described in the answer."

<front>

How do the presence and execution of tests affect `dbt build`?

</front>

<back>

Tests on upstream resources will block downstream resources from running until the tests complete, and a test *failure* will cause those downstream resources to skip entirely (unless the test's severity has been set to "warn"). If a test has multiple interrelated parents, the test will block-and-skip children of the most-downstream parent only.
