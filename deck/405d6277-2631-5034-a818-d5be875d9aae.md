<front>

You are setting up a CI/CD job for state comparision. You added `state: './target-base'` to `dbt_project.yml` but dbt ignores it. How should you fix this?

</front>

<back>

You must move the state configuration to an Environment Variable or pass it via the CLI, as runtime paths cannot be set in `dbt_project.yml`.

Fix using Env Var:
```bash
export DBT_STATE='./target-base'
```
