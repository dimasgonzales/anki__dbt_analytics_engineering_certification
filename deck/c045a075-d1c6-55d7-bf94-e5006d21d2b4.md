What is the preferred method for managing table and view access permissions in dbt, replacing raw SQL DCL statements?

Use the **`grants` resource config**. This allows you to define permissions as a structured dictionary, abstracting the specific SQL syntax for different data warehouses.

Example:
```yaml
models:
  +grants:
    select: ['reporter_role']
```
