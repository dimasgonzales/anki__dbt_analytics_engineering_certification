<front>

A developer runs `dbt test --store-failures` and receives a `permission denied for schema` error. They have full read/write access to their development schema (`dbt_dev`). What is the likely cause?

</front>

<back>

The developer likely lacks permission to create **new** schemas. 

`store_failures` attempts to write to `dbt_dev_dbt_test__audit`. Even if they own `dbt_dev`, they need database-level permissions to generate the separate audit schema.
