  explanation: "The Reference Text mentions that the dbt-labs/audit_helper package is used for 'auditing the results of a query,' which aligns with general validation purposes. However, it does not specifically address its use during migration projects, validate refactored models against legacy tables or stored procedures, or mention macros like 'compare_relations.' Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the answer's details."

What is the primary purpose of the `dbt-labs/audit_helper` package during a migration project?

<back>

It is used to validate that a refactored dbt model produces identical results to an original legacy table or stored procedure. It provides macros like `compare_relations` to check row counts and compare data row-by-row to ensure parity.
