Your `dbt_project.yml` sets `+materialized: view` for a specific directory. However, a model inside that directory contains `{{ config(materialized='table') }}`. How will dbt build this model?

dbt will build the model as a **table**.

The in-file `config()` macro takes precedence over configurations defined in `dbt_project.yml` or property files due to the hierarchy of configuration overrides.
