  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text supports that model-specific configurations set in the model file are effective and override broader configurations, such as those in dbt_project.yml, as illustrated in examples and explanations about applying configurations to individual models."
  citation:
    quote: "Instead, you can specify these configurations at the top of a model `.sql` file, or in its individual YAML properties."

<front>

Your `dbt_project.yml` sets `+materialized: view` for a specific directory. However, a model inside that directory contains `{{ config(materialized='table') }}`. How will dbt build this model?

dbt will build the model as a **table**.

The in-file `config()` macro takes precedence over configurations defined in `dbt_project.yml` or property files due to the hierarchy of configuration overrides.
