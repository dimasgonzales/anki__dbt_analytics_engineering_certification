  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that the --no-compile flag skips re-compilation, which corresponds to step (2) of dbt docs generate. Step (2) involves compiling resources to include compiled code in the manifest.json file, so skipping it means the manifest.json file is not regenerated with updated compiled code. The text also confirms that index.html (step 1) and catalog.json (step 3) are still generated, aligning with the answer."

What does the `--no-compile` flag do when passed to the `dbt docs generate` command?

It skips re-generation of the project's **manifest.json** file (the doc site's index.html and the project's catalog.json file are still generated however)
