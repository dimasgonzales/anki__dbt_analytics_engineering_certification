  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that Passthrough or Rename columns automatically inherit descriptions from upstream and do not require manual definition unless transformed, directly supporting the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "A reused column, labeled as **Passthrough** or **Rename** in the lineage, automatically inherits its description from the source and upstream model columns. The inheritance goes as far back as possible. As long as the column isn't transformed, you don't need to manually define the description; it'll automatically propagate downstream."

<front>

In dbt documentation, how does description inheritance work for 'Passthrough' or 'Rename' columns?

<back>

These columns automatically inherit descriptions from their upstream source or model columns. You do not need to manually define descriptions for these columns in the `schema.yml` files unless you intend to override the upstream description.
