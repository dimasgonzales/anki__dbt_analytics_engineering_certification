  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The Reference Text does not contain information about the `results` context variable in `on-run-end` hooks or its relation to the `run_results.json` artifact. The only mention of `results` is in the context of source freshness, which is unrelated to the question."

What is the `results` context variable in dbt and what data source does it mirror?

<back>

The `results` variable is a list of Result objects available in `on-run-end` hooks that contains execution metadata (status, timing, messages) for every node in the run. It mirrors the data found in the `run_results.json` artifact generated after execution.
