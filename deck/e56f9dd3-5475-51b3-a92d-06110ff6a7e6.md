<front>

A `fct_orders` model currently runs as a `table` materialization, takes 45 minutes to build, and delays the daily pipeline. The source table is very large, but records are immutable after insertion. How should you optimize this model?

<back>

Refactor the model to use the `incremental` materialization strategy. This ensures dbt only processes new records on subsequent runs rather than rebuilding the full table.

```sql
{{ config(
    materialized='incremental',
    unique_key='order_id'
) }}
```

</back>
