  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text confirms that the `config-version` key is optional in `dbt_project.yml` starting from dbt v1.5, but it does not provide explicit information about what dbt assumes or defaults to when this key is omitted. The answer claims it defaults to version 2, but this is not directly supported or contradicted by the evidence."
  citation:
    quote: "starting in v1.5, both the [`config-version: 2`](/reference/project-configs/config-version) and the top-level `version:` key in the `dbt_project.yml` are optional."

<front>

What assumption does dbt make if the `config-version` key is omitted from `dbt_project.yml`?

<back>

dbt defaults to assuming **version 2**. This means the project file is considered valid and will parse correctly even without this specific line present.
