  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly states that in dbt Core v1.5, programmatic invocations are supported using the dbtRunner class from dbt.cli.main and the invoke method with arguments passed as a list of strings, which matches the Answer."
  citation:
    quote: "The entry point is a `dbtRunner` class, which allows you to `invoke` the same commands as on the CLI."

How do you invoke dbt commands programmatically within a Python script in dbt Core v1.5+, instead of using shell subprocesses?

You use the `dbtRunner` class from `dbt.cli.main`. You instantiate the runner and call the `.invoke()` method, passing arguments as a list of strings.

```python
from dbt.cli.main import dbtRunner

res = dbtRunner().invoke(["run", "--select", "my_model"])
```
