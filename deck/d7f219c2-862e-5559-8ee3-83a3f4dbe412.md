<front>

A long-running `dbt run` for a critical production table fails halfway through execution due to a SQL error. What happens to the existing production table?

</front>

<back>

The existing production table remains intact and accessible. 

Because dbt builds the new model in a separate temporary object (e.g., `model__dbt_tmp`), the failure occurs before the swap/rename step, ensuring the live data is not dropped or corrupted.
