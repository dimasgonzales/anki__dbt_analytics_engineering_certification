What is the specific purpose of the `target/compiled/` directory versus the `target/run/` directory in a dbt project?

<back>

`target/compiled/` contains the rendered `SELECT` statements where Jinja has been compiled into pure SQL (useful for logic checks).

`target/run/` contains the executed DDL statements (e.g., `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER VIEW`) sent to the warehouse (useful for debugging database errors).
