<front>

How can you get a list of the names of all DAG nodes selected by the currently-running dbt command? What is the main "gotcha" of this feature?

`selected_resources`. The main gotcha is that the results will be incomplete/incorrect during dbt's parsing phase, so any references to this variable should be wrapped in a `{% if execute %}` block.  
  
This variable is not currently accessible when running code via the `dbt run-operation` command
