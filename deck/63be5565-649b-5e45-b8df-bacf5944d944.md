<front>

You are working in Snowflake. Your raw table is named `CUSTOMERS`, but your dbt source query fails with `Relation "customers" does not exist`. What is the likely cause and solution?

</front>

<back>

The likely cause is that dbt is **quoting** the identifier, forcing a case-sensitive lookup for lowercase `"customers"`.

To fix this, ensure `quoting` for the identifier is set to `false` in your `sources.yml` so dbt generates `customers` (unquoted), which Snowflake resolves to `CUSTOMERS`.
