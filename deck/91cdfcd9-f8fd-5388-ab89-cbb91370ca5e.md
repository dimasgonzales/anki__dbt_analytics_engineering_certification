<front>

In a dbt `schema.yml` file, which nested components can be documented for models and macros respectively?

</front>

<back>

For models (and sources, seeds, snapshots), you can document nested `columns`. For macros, you can document nested `arguments`.

```yaml
macros:
  - name: my_macro
    arguments:
      - name: my_arg
        description: "Arg description"
```

</back>
