  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly mentions the plus operator as part of dbt's shorthand language for selecting subsets of nodes, which aligns with the answer's description of adding a plus sign after the model name to select it and its dependencies."
  citation:
    quote: "dbt supports a shorthand language for defining subsets of nodes. This language uses the following characters: * plus operator [(`+`)](/reference/node-selection/graph-operators#the-plus-operator)"

Add a plus sign (`+`) immediately after the model name.

Example:
```bash
dbt run --select my_model+
```
