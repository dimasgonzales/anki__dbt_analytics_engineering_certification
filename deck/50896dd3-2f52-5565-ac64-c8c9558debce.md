<front>

What are the two available values for the `severity` configuration in dbt tests, and which is the default?

<back>

The available values are `warn` and `error`. The default is `error`, which means the test returns a non-zero exit code on failure (stopping execution). `warn` logs the failure to the console but returns a success exit code (0), allowing the run to proceed.
