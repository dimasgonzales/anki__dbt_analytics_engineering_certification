Which dbt CLI selector and flags are used to execute only models that have changed compared to a production manifest?

You use the `state:modified` selector combined with the `--defer` and `--state` flags. 

Example:
```bash
dbt build --select state:modified+ --defer --state path/to/prod_manifest
```

</back>
