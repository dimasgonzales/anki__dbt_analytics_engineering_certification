<front>

A `relationships` test on a `customer_id` column passes, even though the column contains several `NULL` values that do not exist in the parent table. Why does the test pass?

The `relationships` test automatically filters out `NULL` values in the child table before checking referential integrity. To ensure the column has no nulls AND valid relationships, you must add a separate `not_null` test to the column.
