  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly mentions dbt Core as an open-source command-line tool, which supports part of the answer. However, it does not explicitly mention 'dbt Cloud' as a hosted service; it only refers to dbt CLI and dbt UI, which might relate to dbt Cloud but are not identified as such in the provided text. Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the claim about dbt Cloud."

What are the two primary environments available for executing dbt commands?

<back>

1. **dbt Core**: The open-source command line tool executed locally or on self-hosted infrastructure.
2. **dbt Cloud**: A hosted service that includes an IDE, a job scheduler, and a cloud-based CLI.

Both environments run the same underlying SQL generation logic.
