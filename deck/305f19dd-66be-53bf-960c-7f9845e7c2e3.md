<front>

You rename `models/finance/revenue.sql` to `models/finance/total_revenue.sql` and run dbt. You now see both `revenue` and `total_revenue` tables in your warehouse. Why did this happen and how do you resolve it?

<back>

**Why:** dbt sees the rename as creating a new model (`total_revenue`) and acts as if the old file was deleted. It creates the new table but does not drop the old one.

**Resolution:** You must manually log into the database and run `DROP TABLE/VIEW` on the old `revenue` object.
