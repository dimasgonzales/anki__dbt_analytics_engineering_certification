  explanation: "The reference text discusses state-aware orchestration and artifacts in dbt, but it does not specifically address how state-aware orchestration facilitates 'Models reused' or the mechanism of comparing states to mark unchanged dependencies as 'Reused'. Therefore, there is insufficient information in the provided text to verify or contradict the answer."

How does state-aware orchestration facilitate 'Models reused' in dbt Cloud jobs?

<back>

State-aware orchestration detects code or data changes by comparing the current state to a previous state (artifacts). It automatically marks unchanged upstream dependencies as 'Reused', effectively deferring to the production version of those models rather than rebuilding them.
