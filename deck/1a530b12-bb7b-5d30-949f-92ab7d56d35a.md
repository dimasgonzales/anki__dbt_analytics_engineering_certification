  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer correctly states that enabling a model contract requires setting 'contract: { enforced: true }' in the configuration. The reference text explicitly confirms this and further explains that during build, dbt verifies the model's dataset matches the contract, which must include column names and data types, supporting the answer's claim about validation."

What configuration is required to enable a Model Contract, and what does dbt do when this is enabled?

You must set `contract: { enforced: true }` in the model's configuration. When enabled, dbt validates that the dataset produced by the model exactly matches the columns and data types defined in the YAML schema during the build process.
