  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text mentions dbt model contracts and their purpose of enforcing data structure standards, including column data types, but it does not specify the configuration 'contract: { enforced: true }' or detail the validation process during the build, thus lacking sufficient information to verify the answer."

    quote: "dbt model contracts serve as a governance tool enabling the definition and enforcement of data structure standards in your dbt models. They allow you to specify and uphold data model guarantees, including column data types..."

<front>

What configuration is required to enable a Model Contract, and what does dbt do when this is enabled?

<back>

You must set `contract: { enforced: true }` in the model's configuration. When enabled, dbt validates that the dataset produced by the model exactly matches the columns and data types defined in the YAML schema during the build process.
