<front>

You are troubleshooting a SQL error in the data warehouse logs for a dbt model. The error points to a `CREATE TABLE` statement, but your model file only contains a `SELECT` statement. Why is this happening?

<back>

dbt compiles your model code into raw SQL before execution.

It wraps your `SELECT` statement with the necessary DDL to build the object in the warehouse. You must look at the `target/compiled` or `target/run` files to see the actual SQL dbt executed.
