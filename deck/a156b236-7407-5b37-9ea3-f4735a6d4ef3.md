<front>

To save costs, you want your Snowflake Dynamic Table to refresh every minute in Production but only once every 35 days in Development. How would you implement this configuration?

Define the `target_lag` using an inline Jinja conditional or a macro that checks `target.name`.

Example:
```sql
{{
  config(
    materialized = 'dynamic_table',
    target_lag = '1 minute' if target.name == 'prod' else '35 days'
  )
}}
```

</back>
