  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly describes that dbt Explorer displays only directly referenced public models, while the Studio IDE (part of dbt Cloud IDE) shows indirect dependencies, matching the answer's claim."
  citation:
    quote: "* In Explorer, only directly referenced public models (`upstream_b` in this case) appear. * In the [Studio IDE](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/develop-in-the-cloud) lineage view, however, `upstream_a` (the indirect dependency) *will* appear because dbt dynamically resolves the full dependency graph."

How does the lineage view in dbt Explorer Catalog differ from the dbt Cloud IDE regarding indirect dependencies in a multi-project setup?

<back>

dbt Explorer Catalog filters out indirect dependencies, displaying only public models directly referenced by downstream projects. The dbt Cloud IDE displays the full chain of dependencies, including upstream models (like staging tables) that the referenced public model depends on.
