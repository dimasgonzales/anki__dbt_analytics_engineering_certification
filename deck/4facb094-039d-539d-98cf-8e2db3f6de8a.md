  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly mentions as_bool, as_native, and as_number as filters used to coerce Jinja-compiled output into specific data types (boolean, native Python, and numeric values), which directly supports the core claim of the Answer. However, detailed behavioral aspects like error throwing and deprecation notes are not addressed in the provided text."

How can you coerce Jinja-compiled output into a specific data type?

Using the "as\_" methods:  

- `as_bool`: coerce to True of False, throwing an error if value cannot be coerced
- `as_number`: coerce to a numeric (i.e. int or float) value, throwing an error if value cannot be coerced
- `as_native`: coerce value to its Python native representation. The result can be any Python type (e.g. set, list, tuple, etc). Unlike the other "as\_" methods, as\_native *always* returns a value and doesn't error on "unparseable" input, so you should use the comparatively "safer" as\_bool and as\_number functions where it makes sense rather than always relying on as\_native.

These functions can be used with a "pipe" operator to coerce the value being piped. Example:  

```
my_profile:
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: postgres
      port: "{{ env_var('PGPORT') | as_number }}"
```  
Note: there is also an `as_text` method that is no longer relevant as of dbt v0.17.1, but still technically works.
