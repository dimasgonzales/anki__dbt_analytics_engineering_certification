How can you coerce Jinja-compiled output into a specific data type?

Using the "as\_" methods:  

- `as_bool`: coerce to True of False, throwing an error if value cannot be coerced
- `as_number`: coerce to a numeric (i.e. int or float) value, throwing an error if value cannot be coerced
- `as_native`: coerce value to its Python native representation. The result can be any Python type (e.g. set, list, tuple, etc). Unlike the other "as\_" methods, as\_native *always* returns a value and doesn't error on "unparseable" input, so you should use the comparatively "safer" as\_bool and as\_number functions where it makes sense rather than always relying on as\_native.

These functions can be used with a "pipe" operator to coerce the value being piped. Example:  

```
my_profile:
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: postgres
      port: "{{ env_var('PGPORT') | as_number }}"
```  
Note: there is also an `as_text` method that is no longer relevant as of dbt v0.17.1, but still technically works.
