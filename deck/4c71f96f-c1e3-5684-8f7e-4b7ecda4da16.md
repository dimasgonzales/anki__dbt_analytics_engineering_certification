<front>

You receive a 'profile not found' error despite having a `profiles.yml` file on your machine. How would you determine which directory dbt is checking for this file?

Run the following command to reveal the search path:
```bash
dbt debug --config-dir
```
This will tell you if dbt is looking in the default `~/.dbt` folder or a different custom directory.
