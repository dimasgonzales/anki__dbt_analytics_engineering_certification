<front>

You need to create a dashboard showing the average execution time for models grouped by their 'owner' tag. How would you accomplish this?

<back>

Join `run_results.json` with `manifest.json` using `unique_id`.

1. Extract `execution_time` from `run_results.json`.
2. Extract the `tags` or meta config from the `nodes` dictionary in `manifest.json`.

This is necessary because `run_results.json` does not contain static node configuration like tags.
