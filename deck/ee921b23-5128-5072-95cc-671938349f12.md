<front>

You are reviewing a `sources.yml` file and notice it starts with `version: 2`. Does this indicate that the source data tables are in their second version?

No. The `version: 2` key at the top of a `.yml` file refers strictly to the **YAML file parsing schema** required by dbt.

It does not describe the version of the data, the models, or the project itself. It simply instructs dbt how to read the file structure.
