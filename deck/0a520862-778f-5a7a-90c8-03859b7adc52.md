<front>

You are adding a contract to an existing incremental model but receive an error regarding configuration. You have not set `on_schema_change`. How should you update your YAML config to fix this?

<back>

You must explicitly configure `on_schema_change` to handle schema evolution safely.

Example update:
```yaml
config:
  materialized: incremental
  contract:
    enforced: true
  on_schema_change: append_new_columns
```

</back>
