<front>

You need to install a package located in a specific sub-folder (`macros-folder`) of a GitHub repository branch (`dev`). How do you configure this in `packages.yml`?

You must use the `git` URL, the `revision` for the branch, and the optional `subdirectory` key to point to the specific folder.

Example:
```yaml
packages:
  - git: "https://github.com/org/repo"
    revision: "dev"
    subdirectory: "macros-folder"
```
