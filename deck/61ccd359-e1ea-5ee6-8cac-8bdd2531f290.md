<front>

You successfully ran `dbt build`, but when you try to `SELECT *` from an intermediate model in your warehouse console, you get a "relation does not exist" error. What is the likely cause?

The model is likely configured with **ephemeral** materialization.

Since ephemeral models are compiled as CTEs into downstream queries, they do not exist as physical objects in the warehouse and cannot be queried directly.
