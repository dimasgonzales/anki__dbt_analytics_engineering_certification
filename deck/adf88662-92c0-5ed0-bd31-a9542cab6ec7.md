<front>

You want to run only the models that are BOTH tagged `nightly` AND appear downstream of the `snowplow` source, OR any model located in the `export` folder. How do you write this selector?

</front>

<back>

You combine the intersection (comma) and union (space) logic.

Command:
```bash
dbt run --select "source:snowplow+,tag:nightly models/export"
```
Logic: (Downstream of Snowplow AND Tagged Nightly) OR (Models in Export folder).

</back>
