<front>

A model is defined as `materialized: view` in `dbt_project.yml`, but the model's SQL file contains `{{ config(materialized='table') }}`. How will dbt build this model?

<back>

dbt will build the model as a **table**.

This occurs because the in-file `{{ config() }}` macro is the most specific configuration method and takes precedence over project-level settings in `dbt_project.yml`.
