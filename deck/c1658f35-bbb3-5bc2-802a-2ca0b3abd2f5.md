  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text confirms that model groups are used to organize models under common ownership and enable private access control, where private models are restricted to references within the same group."
  citation:
    quote: "Models can be grouped under a common designation with a shared owner. ... It enables you to designate certain models as having 'private' access—for use exclusively within that group."

Model Groups define ownership (such as team contact info) and create boundaries for `private` access control.

They allow you to segment a project so that `private` models can only be referenced by other models within the same group.
