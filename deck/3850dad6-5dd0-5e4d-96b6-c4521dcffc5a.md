  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly states that model access modifiers control where models can be referenced, aligning with the Answer's description of the purpose. It also describes private and protected access similarly to the Answer's values, and mentions public models, supporting the overall claim."
  citation:
    quote: "A [model access modifier](/docs/mesh/govern/model-access) in dbt determines if a model is accessible as an input to other dbt models and projects. It specifies where a model can be referenced using [the `ref` function](/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/ref)."

What is the purpose of the `access` configuration key in a dbt model?

<back>

It defines the governance interface for the model, specifically controlling how it can be referenced.

Values include:
*   `public`: Available across projects.
*   `protected`: Available within the project and namespaces.
*   `private`: Available only within the same group.
