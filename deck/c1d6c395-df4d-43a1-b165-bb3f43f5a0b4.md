How can you store/reuse node selector definitions in your project repo?
</front>

<back>

Using **YAML Selectors**. Create a top-level file called `selectors.yml` in your repo. This file should have a top-level key of `selectors:`, mapped to a list of selector definitions. Each selector must have a `name` and `definition`, and can optionally have a `description` and `default` flag. The `definition` can be a simple CLI-style selector string, a set of key value pairs, or a full, rich YAML object.  
  
Selectors can be invoked in the CLI using the `--selector <name>` option.
