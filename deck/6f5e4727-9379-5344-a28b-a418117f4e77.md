<front>

You are working in the `marketing` project and try to run `select * from {{ ref('dim_customers') }}`. The model exists in the upstream `core_data` project and is public, but dbt returns a "Model not found" error. What is the cause?

</front>

<back>

You are using a single-argument ref, which searches only the current project (`marketing`) and installed packages. 

To reference a model in a different upstream project, you must use the two-argument syntax:
```sql
{{ ref('core_data', 'dim_customers') }}
```

</back>
