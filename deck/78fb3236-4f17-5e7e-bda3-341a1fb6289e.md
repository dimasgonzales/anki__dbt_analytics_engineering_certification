<front>

You need to trigger a dbt run that executes all models in the `finance` package AND all models tagged `nightly` in a single command. How would you structure this?

</front>

<back>

Use space-separated selectors to apply Union logic. This ensures dbt runs the combination of both sets (anything in the finance package plus anything with the nightly tag).

Command:
```bash
dbt run --select package:finance tag:nightly
```

</back>
