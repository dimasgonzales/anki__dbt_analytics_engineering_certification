  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer accurately describes selected_resources as a list of strings representing fully qualified Node IDs, which is explicitly supported by the reference text stating it is a list and providing example identifiers that match the format."
  citation:
    quote: "The `selected_resources` context variable is a list of all the resources selected by the current dbt command selector. For a given run it will look like: `[\"model.my_project.model1\", \"model.my_project.model2\", \"snapshot.my_project.my_snapshot\"]`"

It contains a list of strings representing the fully qualified **Node IDs** of the resources matching the CLI selection criteria. An example value in the list would be `'model.project_name.model_name'`.
