You need to forecast revenue using the `prophet` library on data stored in Snowflake. How should you implement this in dbt?

Create a **Python model** (`.py` file).

Python models allow you to import libraries like `prophet` or `pandas` to perform advanced analytics and ML workflows directly within the dbt DAG, which cannot be achieved with standard SQL.
```python
def model(dbt, session):
    # ML logic here
    return df
```
