  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly supports the answer by stating that structuring dbt models with CTEs and a final select statement facilitates troubleshooting, as developers can easily step through CTEs instead of dealing with nested queries, which aligns with the answer's claim about improved debuggability."

<front>

Why is it recommended to structure dbt models using Functional CTEs and end with a `select *` from the final CTE?

<back>

This structure significantly improves **debuggability**. By separating transformations into logical steps (Functional CTEs), a developer can audit the data at any stage by simply changing the final `select` statement to target an upstream CTE instead of the final one.
