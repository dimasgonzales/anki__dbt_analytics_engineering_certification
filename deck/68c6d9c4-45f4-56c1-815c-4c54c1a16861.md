<front>

You have an intermediate model `int_margin_adjustments` containing sensitive logic that should only be used by other finance models. How do you restrict its usage in dbt?

</front>

<back>

Set the access to `private` and assign it to the `finance` group in your YAML configuration.

```yaml
models:
  - name: int_margin_adjustments
    group: finance
    access: private
```
This prevents models outside the `finance` group from referencing it.
