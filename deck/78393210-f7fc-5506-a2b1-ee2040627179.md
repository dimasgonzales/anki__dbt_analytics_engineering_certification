<front>

In a dbt Mesh architecture, which file is used to configure upstream project references, and how does it differ from standard package management?

</front>

<back>

Upstream projects are configured in a `dependencies.yml` file, not `packages.yml`. This file specifically handles cross-project references where you do not want to import the full source code, but rather reference the public models of another project.

Example config:
```yaml
projects:
  - name: analytics
```
