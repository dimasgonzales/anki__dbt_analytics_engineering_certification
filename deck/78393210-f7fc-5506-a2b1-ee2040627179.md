  explanation: "The Reference Text discusses cross-project references in dbt Mesh, explaining that public models can be referenced without importing full source code, which aligns with part of the Answer. However, it does not mention or specify the use of a `dependencies.yml` file for configuring upstream projects, leaving the specific file name unverified."

In a dbt Mesh architecture, which file is used to configure upstream project references, and how does it differ from standard package management?

Upstream projects are configured in a `dependencies.yml` file, not `packages.yml`. This file specifically handles cross-project references where you do not want to import the full source code, but rather reference the public models of another project.

Example config:
```yaml
projects:
  - name: analytics
```
