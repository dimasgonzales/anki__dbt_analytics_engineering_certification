<front>

You are building a downstream model and need to select only the **current** active records from a snapshot. How do you write the SQL query?

<back>

You must filter the snapshot table where the `dbt_valid_to` column is null.

```sql
select *
from {{ ref('orders_snapshot') }}
where dbt_valid_to is null
```
