<front>

In `dbt_project.yml`, you define `+materialized: table` for a specific folder. However, inside a model within that folder, you include `{{ config(materialized='view') }}`. 

How will this model be materialized upon running `dbt run`?

The specific configuration inside the SQL file overrides the directory-level configuration defined in the YAML file.
