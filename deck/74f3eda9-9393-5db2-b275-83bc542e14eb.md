<front>

When configuring a test's error/warn behavior, how to the `severity`, `error_if`, and `warn_if` config options interact with each other?

- If `severity: error`, dbt will check the `error_if` condition first. If the error condition is met, the test returns an error. If it's not met, dbt will then check the `warn_if` condition. If the warn condition is met, the test warns; if it's not met, the test passes.
- If `severity: warn`, dbt will skip the `error_if` condition entirely and jump straight to the `warn_if` condition. If the warn condition is met, the test warns; if it's not met, the test passes.
