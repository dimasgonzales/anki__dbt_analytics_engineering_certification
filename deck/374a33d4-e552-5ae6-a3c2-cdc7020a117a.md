<front>

You removed a role from the `grants` list in your model configuration, but after running `dbt run`, the role still has access to the table in the database. What is the most likely cause?

<back>

You likely removed the entire `grants` configuration block instead of passing an empty list. 

If dbt sees no `grants` config, it assumes it should not manage permissions for that model. To force a revocation, you must explicitly configure the privilege with an empty list:
```python
grants = {'select': []}
```
