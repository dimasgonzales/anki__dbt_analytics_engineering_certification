  explanation: "The Answer correctly describes post-hooks as SQL executed automatically after a model is built and operations as macros executed explicitly via the CLI, which aligns with the explicit definitions in the Reference Text."

What is the difference between a `post-hook` and an `operation` in dbt?

<back>

A **post-hook** is SQL executed automatically after a specific model is built (e.g., granting permissions, indexing). An **operation** (run via `dbt run-operation`) is a macro executed explicitly via the CLI for ad-hoc maintenance or project-level tasks not tied to a specific model run.
