  explanation: "The reference text mentions 'post-hook' in the context of comparing it to the 'grants' config, implying its use for SQL execution after models, but it does not explicitly define 'post-hook' as described in the answer. Additionally, there is no mention of 'operation' or 'dbt run-operation' in the provided text, so insufficient information is available to verify the definitions or the comparison between the two."

<front>

What is the difference between a `post-hook` and an `operation` in dbt?

<back>

A **post-hook** is SQL executed automatically after a specific model is built (e.g., granting permissions, indexing). An **operation** (run via `dbt run-operation`) is a macro executed explicitly via the CLI for ad-hoc maintenance or project-level tasks not tied to a specific model run.
