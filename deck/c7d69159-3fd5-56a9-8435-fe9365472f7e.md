  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text does not provide explicit evidence for the hierarchy structure 'seeds -> [project_name] -> [seed_name]' as stated in the answer. While an example shows configuration at the project level ('seeds: snowplow: +schema: snowplow_seeds'), it does not include or mention [seed_name] in the hierarchy, and there is no information about omitting the project name being a common error. Therefore, the evidence is insufficient to verify the answer."

<front>

What is the required hierarchy structure when configuring specific seeds in `dbt_project.yml`?

<back>

The required hierarchy is `seeds` -> `[project_name]` -> `[seed_name]`. Omitting the project name is a common configuration error that results in the config not being applied.
