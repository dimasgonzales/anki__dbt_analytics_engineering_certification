  explanation: "The reference text only explicitly states that 'dbt retry re-executes the last dbt command from the node point of failure,' which supports part of the answer. However, the answer includes additional claims about utilizing artifacts, identifying failed or skipped resources, and ignoring succeeded ones, which are not mentioned or verified in the provided text. Therefore, there is not enough information in the reference text to fully verify the entire answer."

<back>

`dbt retry` re-executes the last command starting specifically from the point of failure. It utilizes the artifacts produced by the previous run to identify failed or skipped resources and ignores those that already succeeded.
