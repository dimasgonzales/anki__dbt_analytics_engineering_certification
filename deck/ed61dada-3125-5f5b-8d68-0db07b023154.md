When troubleshooting a dbt model failure, what is the difference between the files found in `target/compiled/` and `target/run/`?

**`target/compiled/`**: Contains the raw `SELECT` statement with all Jinja (refs, vars) resolved to actual strings.

**`target/run/`**: Contains the executable **DDL** (e.g., `CREATE VIEW ... AS SELECT ...`) exactly as dbt attempted to run it against the warehouse.
