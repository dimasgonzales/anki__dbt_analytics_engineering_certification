  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text confirms that targets like 'dev' and 'prod' are used to differentiate environments in dbt, but it does not mention the specific CLI command or the '--target' flag for executing against a target. Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the correctness of the answer."

<front>

You have `dev` and `prod` outputs defined in your `profiles.yml`. How do you execute your dbt project against the `prod` environment specifically?

<back>

Use the `--target` (or `-t`) flag in your CLI command:

```bash
dbt run --target prod
```

This instructs dbt to use the connection details associated with the `prod` target in your profile.
