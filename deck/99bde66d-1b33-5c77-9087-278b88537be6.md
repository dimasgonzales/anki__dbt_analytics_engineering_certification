  explanation: "The Reference Text lists 'merge' and 'insert_overwrite' as strategies and briefly describes 'merge' as inserting new and updating existing records, but it does not detail their operational differences, such as unique key matches or partition replacement, as mentioned in the Answer."

<front>

<back>

`merge` updates or inserts rows line-by-line based on a unique key match. `insert_overwrite` replaces entire partitions (e.g., all data for a specific date) in the destination table, which is often more performant and cost-effective on platforms like BigQuery.
