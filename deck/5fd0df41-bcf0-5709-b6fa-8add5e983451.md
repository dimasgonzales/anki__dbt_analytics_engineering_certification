<front>

You want to temporarily prevent a block of complex Jinja logic inside your model from executing or compiling. Why is using SQL comments (`--`) insufficient, and what should you use instead?

</front>

<back>

SQL comments (`--`) only hide the *result* in the final SQL; the Jinja logic still executes during compilation, which might cause errors. To prevent Jinja execution entirely, you must use **Jinja comments**: `{# ... #}`.
