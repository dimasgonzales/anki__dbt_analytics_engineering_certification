<front>

A production job fails during the `dbt source freshness` step because the data is 24 hours older than the `error_after` threshold. What happens to the subsequent `dbt build` step in that job?

</front>

<back>

The subsequent step is **skipped/blocked**.

If `dbt source freshness` exits with an error code (which happens when an `error_after` threshold is breached), the job stops immediately to prevent processing stale data.
