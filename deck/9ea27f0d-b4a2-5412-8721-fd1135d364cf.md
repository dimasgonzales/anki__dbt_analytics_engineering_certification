  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that incremental_predicates is used to enhance performance by limiting scans in large data volumes, which directly supports the answer's claims about optimization and preventing full table scans."
  citation:
    quote: "`incremental_predicates` is an advanced use of incremental models, where data volume is large enough to justify additional investments in performance."

What is the purpose of the `incremental_predicates` configuration in dbt incremental models?

<back>

It optimizes performance by pushing custom filters down to the merge operation, limiting the scan to relevant partitions or rows in the destination table. This prevents expensive full table scans when updating large tables.
