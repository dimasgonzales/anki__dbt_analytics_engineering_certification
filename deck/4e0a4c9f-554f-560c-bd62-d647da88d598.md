  explanation: "The reference text provides evidence that variables are defined in dbt_project.yml, as indicated by the --vars flag overriding them. However, it does not contain any information on how to reference these variables in SQL models using the var() Jinja function, leaving part of the answer unverifiable."

How do you define a global variable in `dbt_project.yml` and how do you reference it in a SQL model?

<back>

Define it under the `vars:` dictionary in `dbt_project.yml` and reference it using the `var()` Jinja function.

**Definition:**
```yaml
vars:
  my_variable: 100
```
**Usage:**
```sql
select * from table where id > {{ var('my_variable') }}
```

</back>
