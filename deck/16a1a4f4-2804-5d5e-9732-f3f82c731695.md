  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer is explicitly supported by the reference text, which explains that the `--defer` flag uses a state manifest (such as manifest.json) from another environment to resolve references to upstream dependencies, allowing specific models to be run without requiring local rebuilds."
  citation:
    quote: "When `--defer` is enabled, dbt resolves ref calls using the state manifest instead, but only if: 1. The node isn’t among the selected nodes, *and* 2. It doesn’t exist in the database (or `--favor-state` is used)."

<front>

What is the primary purpose of the `--defer` flag (or 'Defer to production' setting) in dbt?

<back>

It allows developers to run specific models without building their upstream parents locally. By referencing a **state** file (manifest.json) from another environment (like production), dbt treats upstream dependencies as existing tables in that environment rather than requiring a local rebuild.
