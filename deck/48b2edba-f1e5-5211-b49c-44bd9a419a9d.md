What is the structure of a dbt resource's **Unique ID** used internally and in the manifest?

<back>

The structure is `resource_type.package_name.resource_name`.

For example:
```text
model.my_dbt_project.stg_orders
```
This format ensures every node in the DAG is uniquely addressable across all installed packages.
