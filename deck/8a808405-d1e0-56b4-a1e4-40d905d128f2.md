<front>

You have a source table located in `raw_prod` for production and `raw_dev` for development. Instead of creating two separate source YML files, how should you configure this in dbt to follow DRY principles?

</front>

<back>

Define a single source in `sources.yml` and set the `database` property using an environment variable. You then define the specific database values (e.g., `raw_prod`, `raw_dev`) in the Environment Variables settings of your dbt Cloud project or local setup.

```yaml
sources:
  - name: my_source
    database: "{{ env_var('DB_NAME') }}"
```

</back>
