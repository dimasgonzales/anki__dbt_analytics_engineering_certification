<front>

What are the two strategies dbt uses for snapshots and which one is generally recommended?

The two strategies are `timestamp` and `check`. The `timestamp` strategy is recommended as it uses an `updated_at` column to detect changes and handles schema changes better. The `check` strategy works by comparing specific columns listed in `check_cols`.
