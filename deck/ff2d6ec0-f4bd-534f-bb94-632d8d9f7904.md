  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text confirms that an error state indicates the data is stale, but it does not explicitly mention the 'error_after' threshold or provide specific details about the freshness configuration mechanism involving 'loaded_at_field'. The text supports the general concept of staleness leading to errors but lacks information to verify the precise reason given in the answer."

<back>
