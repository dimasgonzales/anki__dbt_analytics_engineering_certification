  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly confirms that seeds are version-controlled and code reviewable because they are stored in the dbt repository, which directly supports the Answer's claim that changes to seed files are tracked through version control and are auditable."

Because seeds are CSV files stored within the project's file structure, they are committed to **git** like any other code artifact. This ensures that changes to static data (like mapping logic) are version-controlled, auditable, and synchronized with the model logic that relies on them.
