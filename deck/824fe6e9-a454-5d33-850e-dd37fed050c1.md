<front>

You are working on a feature branch and want to run models only if they have been changed compared to the production code. Which selector should you use?

Use the `state:modified` selector combined with a path to the production manifest.

Example:
```bash
dbt run --select state:modified --state path/to/prod/artifacts
```
