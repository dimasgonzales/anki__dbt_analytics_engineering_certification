  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that in dbt_project.yml, variables cannot be defined and used internally because the file is parsed before Jinja rendering; instead, variables must be passed via CLI --vars or use env_var()."
  citation:
    quote: "In `dbt_project.yml`, `packages.yml`, and `profiles.yml` files, you must pass `vars` through the CLI using `--vars`, not defined inside the `vars:` block in the YAML file. This is because these files are parsed before Jinja is rendered."

<front>

Why can you not use `{{ var('my_var') }}` inside `dbt_project.yml` if `my_var` is defined in the `vars:` block of that same file?

<back>

You cannot use variables defined in `dbt_project.yml` within the same file because it is parsed before the Jinja context for those variables is created.

To use dynamic values in `dbt_project.yml`, you must use environment variables (`env_var()`) or pass variables via the CLI (`--vars`).
