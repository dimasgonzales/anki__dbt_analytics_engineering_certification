<front>

How can you force dbt to recognize a dependency between two models? Why would you need to?

</front>

<back>

Putting the following comment at the top of the model's SQL file:  

```
-- depends_on: {{ ref('upstream_parent_model') }}
```
  
One scenario that might call for this is if your model just calls a macro (and any upstream resource references are in the macro, not explicitly anywhere in the model). dbt won't be able to tie your model and its parents together automatically, but you can force the connection using this comment syntax.
