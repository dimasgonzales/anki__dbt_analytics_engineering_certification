<front>

You are deploying dbt on a platform (like AWS Glue) that throws an error because it cannot perform atomic table swaps. How should you configure your `dbt_project.yml` to resolve this?

<back>

Set `on_table_exists` to `drop`. This instructs dbt to drop the existing table before creating the new one, bypassing the need for atomic renaming logic.

```yaml
models:
  +on_table_exists: drop
```

</back>
