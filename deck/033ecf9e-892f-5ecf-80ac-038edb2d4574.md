<front>

A user submits a ticket claiming their local environment is broken because `dbt --version` shows `dbt-core: 1.8.0` and `dbt-bigquery: 1.9.0`. How would you troubleshoot this?

<back>

This is likely **not an error** and requires no troubleshooting if the project is on dbt Core v1.8+.

Because adapter and core versioning are decoupled starting in v1.8, having a higher minor version for the adapter than the core is a valid configuration.
