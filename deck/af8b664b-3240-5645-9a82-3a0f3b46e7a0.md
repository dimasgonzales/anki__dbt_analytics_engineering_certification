<front>

A colleague pushed new code to a package's git branch, but running `dbt deps` locally is not pulling the new commits. What is the likely cause and solution?

<back>

**Cause:** dbt is installing from `package-lock.yml`, which references the old commit SHA.
**Solution:** Run `dbt deps --upgrade`. This ignores the lock file and fetches the latest commit for that branch.
