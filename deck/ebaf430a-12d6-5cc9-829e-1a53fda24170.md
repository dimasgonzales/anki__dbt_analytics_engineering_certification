  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that model.batch can be None outside of specific execution contexts and emphasizes the need to check before accessing properties, which directly supports the answer's reasoning."
  citation:
    quote: "`model.batch` is only available during the execution of a microbatch model batch. Outside of the microbatch execution, `model.batch` is `None`, and its sub-properties aren't accessible."

<front>

Why is it critical to check if a context-dependent object (like `model.batch`) exists before accessing its properties?

<back>

Because these objects may be `None` during specific phases (like parsing) or execution modes (like a full refresh). Accessing properties on `None` will cause the compilation to fail with a runtime error.
