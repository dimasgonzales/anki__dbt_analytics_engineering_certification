  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly states that when the `unique_key` is omitted in an incremental model, dbt uses `append`-only behavior, inserting all rows without checking for duplicates, which directly matches the Answer."
  citation:
    quote: "If you don't specify a `unique_key`, most adapters will result in `append`-only behavior, which means dbt inserts all rows returned by the model's SQL into the preexisting target table without regard for whether the rows represent duplicates."

<front>

What is the default behavior of an incremental model if the `unique_key` configuration is omitted?

</front>

<back>

dbt defaults to the `append` strategy. Instead of matching and updating existing records, dbt will insert all rows from the model execution into the target table, potentially resulting in duplicate records.
