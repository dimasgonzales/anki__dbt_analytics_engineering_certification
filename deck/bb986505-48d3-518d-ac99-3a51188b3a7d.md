  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly instructs to enable write access for the deploy key when setting up GitHub integration, stating that this allows dbt to read and write files, which aligns with the need for write permissions in the dbt Cloud IDE for committing changes."

    quote: "After supplying a name for the deploy key and pasting in your deploy key (generated by dbt), be sure to check the Allow write access checkbox."
