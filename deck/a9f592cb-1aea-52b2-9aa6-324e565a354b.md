  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly states that the `is_incremental()` macro returns false when the `--full-refresh` flag is specified, which directly supports the answer."

It evaluates to `false`. The `--full-refresh` flag forces dbt to ignore existing tables and rebuild the model from scratch, effectively treating it as a non-incremental run regardless of the materialization logic.
