<front>

What dbt CLI selector syntax is used to run all upstream models required to populate a specific exposure?

</front>

<back>

Use the `+` prefix before the exposure selector. 
```bash
dbt run --select +exposure:exposure_name
```
This commands dbt to build all parents (upstream dependencies) of the specified exposure.
