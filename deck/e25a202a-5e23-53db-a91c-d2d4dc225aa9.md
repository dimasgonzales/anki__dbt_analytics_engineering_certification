  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer correctly identifies dbt seeds as CSV files for static data like country codes, located in the seeds directory by default, and loaded using the 'dbt seed' command, all of which are explicitly supported by the reference text."
  citation:
    quote: "The `dbt seed` command will load `csv` files located in the `seed-paths` directory of your dbt project into your data warehouse."
