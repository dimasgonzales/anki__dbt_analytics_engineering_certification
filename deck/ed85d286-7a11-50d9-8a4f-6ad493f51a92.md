  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly distinguishes between properties and configurations, stating that properties are declared in properties.yml files and cannot be defined in SQL config blocks or dbt_project.yml, which directly supports the answer."

<front>

What is the primary restriction on where dbt 'properties' (such as `description`, `data_tests`, and `columns`) can be defined?

<back>

Resource properties must **strictly** be defined in `.yml` files (e.g., `schema.yml`).

Unlike configurations (like `materialized` or `tags`), you cannot define properties like `description` or `tests` inside a SQL file's `{{ config() }}` block or `dbt_project.yml`.
