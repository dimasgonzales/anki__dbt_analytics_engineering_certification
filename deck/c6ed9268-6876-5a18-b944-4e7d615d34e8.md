<front>

You need to change the data type of the `customer_id` column in a public model from `int` to `string`, which will break downstream consumers. How should you handle this using dbt's versioning features?

</front>

<back>

Create a new model version (e.g., `v2`) with the new data type while keeping `v1` available. You can mark `v1` with a `deprecation_date` to signal consumers to migrate, ensuring stability while introducing the breaking change.

```yaml
versions:
  - v: 2
  - v: 1
    deprecation_date: 2024-12-31
```
