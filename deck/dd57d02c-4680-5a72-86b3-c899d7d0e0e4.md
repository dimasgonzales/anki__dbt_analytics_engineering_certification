<front>

Your dbt project has syntax errors in several YAML files, but you need to verify if your database credentials are valid immediately. How can you test the credentials without fixing the YAML errors first?

```bash
dbt debug --connection
```
This bypasses the project code validation and strictly tests the connection to the database.
