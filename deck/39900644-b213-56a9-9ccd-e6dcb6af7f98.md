  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text outlines the order of precedence for environment variables in dbt Cloud, stating that job-level overrides have the highest precedence, which means they take priority over environment-level variables. This directly supports the answer that '600' from the job override will be used instead of '300' from the environment level."

<front>

You have defined `DBT_TIMEOUT` as '300' at the Environment level, but a specific scheduled job requires a longer timeout and has `DBT_TIMEOUT` set to '600' in its Job Overrides. Which value will be used when the job runs?

<back>

**600**.

dbt Cloud prioritizes Job Overrides over Environment-level variables. The hierarchy ensures that specific job requirements can supersede general environment settings without changing the global configuration.
