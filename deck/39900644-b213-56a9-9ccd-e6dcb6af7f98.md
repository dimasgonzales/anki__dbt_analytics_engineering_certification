  explanation: "The Reference Text does not contain any explicit information about `DBT_TIMEOUT` or the specific prioritization of job overrides over environment-level variables for timeout settings. While it mentions that job-level settings like dbt version can override environment defaults, this does not directly support or contradict the answer regarding `DBT_TIMEOUT`."

<front>

You have defined `DBT_TIMEOUT` as '300' at the Environment level, but a specific scheduled job requires a longer timeout and has `DBT_TIMEOUT` set to '600' in its Job Overrides. Which value will be used when the job runs?

<back>

**600**.

dbt Cloud prioritizes Job Overrides over Environment-level variables. The hierarchy ensures that specific job requirements can supersede general environment settings without changing the global configuration.
