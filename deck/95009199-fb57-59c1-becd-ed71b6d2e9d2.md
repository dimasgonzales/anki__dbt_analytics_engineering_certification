You want to update your production schema only after a full build and test suite has passed in a staging environment. How would you sequence your dbt commands to achieve this?

1. Build and test in staging:
```bash
dbt build --target staging
```
2. If successful, promote to production using the staging artifacts:
```bash
dbt clone --state target/ --target prod
```
