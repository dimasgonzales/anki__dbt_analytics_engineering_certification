<front>

You are setting up a CI pipeline and want to check that new model changes contain valid SQL syntax without running a full expensive build. Which command pattern should you use?

Use `dbt run` with the `--empty` flag.

Example:
```bash
dbt run --select state:modified+ --empty
```
This creates the objects in the warehouse to ensure validity but processes no data rows.
