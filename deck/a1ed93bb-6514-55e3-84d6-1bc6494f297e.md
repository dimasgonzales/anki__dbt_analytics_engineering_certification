  explanation: "The reference text from the dbt documentation explicitly defines the 'overrides' property for sources, confirming that it allows overriding a source in an included package and describes how properties are applied, which directly matches the answer."

What does the `overrides` source config do?

<back>

It allows you to override a source defined in an installed package with your own source definition (you pass the package name in question to the config property). The properties defined in the overriding source (yours) will be applied on top of the base properties of the overridden source.  
  
This may be useful for adding custom freshness checks, or writing a package source to a non-default schema, etc.
