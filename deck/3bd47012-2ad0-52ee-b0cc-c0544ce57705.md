  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text supports the answer by describing how `{% docs %}` blocks allow for markdown descriptions, which enables complex formatting and implies separation from YAML configuration. While it doesn't explicitly state that this keeps YAML files clean, the functionality aligns with the answer's claims."

<back>

It separates content (Markdown) from configuration (YAML). This keeps `schema.yml` files clean and readable while allowing for complex formatting (tables, headers, lists) and long-form text in dedicated markdown files.
