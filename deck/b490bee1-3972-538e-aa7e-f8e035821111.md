<front>

A CI/CD pipeline fails during the seed step with the error: `Error: invalid identifier 'REGION_CODE'`. The 'REGION_CODE' header is present in the CSV. What is the likely cause?

<back>

The likely cause is that the `REGION_CODE` column was recently added to the CSV, but the existing table in the warehouse was created before this addition. The table needs to be rebuilt using `dbt seed --full-refresh`.
