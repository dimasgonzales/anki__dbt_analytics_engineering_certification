<front>

You have upgraded your Production Environment to the 'Latest' release track. However, a specific legacy job is failing due to a deprecated function in the new version.

How can you keep the Environment on 'Latest' while resolving the issue for this specific job?

<back>

Edit the specific Job settings and **manually override** the dbt version to the previous working version (e.g., a pinned version). 

This allows the specific legacy job to continue running on the older version while the rest of the Environment and other jobs utilize the 'Latest' features.
