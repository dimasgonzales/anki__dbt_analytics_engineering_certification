<front>

You have placed a `{{ log(...) }}` statement directly in the middle of a SQL `WHERE` clause in your model. What effect will this have on the final compiled SQL query?

</front>

<back>

It will have no effect on the SQL syntax. Since `log` returns an empty string, the SQL remains valid, and the log message is output during compilation.

```sql
WHERE id > 100 {{ log("filtering ids", info=True) }}
-- Renders as: WHERE id > 100
```

</back>
