<front>

You are configuring the commands for a dbt Cloud Production Job and add `dbt --version` as the first step to log the environment details. Is this a valid configuration?

<back>

No, this is **invalid**. The `--version` flag is a CLI-specific diagnostic tool and should not be used as a command step in a managed production job. The dbt version in dbt Cloud is determined by the Environment settings, not a command step.
