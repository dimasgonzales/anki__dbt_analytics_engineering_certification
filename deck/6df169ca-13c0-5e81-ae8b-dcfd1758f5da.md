  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer correctly identifies 'require-dbt-version' as the field, with the ability to disable checks via '--no-version-check'. The default no version check is implied by the CLI option description, and the field's purpose is confirmed."

    quote: "From CITATION: 'You can use `require-dbt-version` to restrict your project to only work with a range of dbt versions.'

Otherwise, allow them to differ.'"

<front>

What **dbt\_project.yml** field is used to restrict your project to only work with a specific range of dbt versions? What is the default? Can this check be situationally disabled?

**require-dbt-version**. Values can be passed as strings or as a list of strings using standard comparison operators. E.g.:  

- ">=1.0.0"
- ">=1.0.0,<2.0.0"
- [">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"]

By default, no such version check is performed/all versions are permitted. If a version of dbt used to invoke a project disagrees with the listed requirements, dbt throws a Runtime Error.

Version checks can be disabled for a given run using the `--no-version-check` CLI option
