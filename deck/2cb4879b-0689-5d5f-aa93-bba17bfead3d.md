  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text mentions the `meta` key as accepting a dictionary in configuration contexts, but it does not specifically address source definitions or confirm the answer's claims about addition to `manifest.json`, the documentation site, or lack of effect on compilation and execution logic. Insufficient evidence is available to verify the full answer."

<front>

What is the primary purpose of the `meta` configuration key in dbt source definitions?

<back>

The `meta` key allows you to define a dictionary of arbitrary properties (like owners, tags, or system IDs) that are added to `manifest.json` and the documentation site. These properties do not affect dbt's compilation or execution logic.
