<front>

You are splitting a monolithic dbt repository into two projects: `core` and `finance`. You need to select data from `dim_users` (located in `core`) inside a model in the `finance` project. How do you accomplish this?

<back>

You must use the cross-project reference syntax in the `finance` model's SQL file. Additionally, the `dim_users` model in the `core` project must be configured with `access: public` to allow the reference.

```sql
-- In finance project model
select * from {{ ref('core', 'dim_users') }}
```

</back>
