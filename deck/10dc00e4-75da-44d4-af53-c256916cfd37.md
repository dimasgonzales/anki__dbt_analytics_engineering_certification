<front>
How do the presence and execution of tests affect `dbt build`?
</front>

<back>

Tests on upstream resources will block downstream resources from running until the tests complete, and a test *failure* will cause those downstream resources to skip entirely (unless the test's severity has been set to "warn"). If a test has multiple interrelated parents, the test will block-and-skip children of the most-downstream parent only.
