  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that the --full-refresh flag causes dbt to drop the existing target table and rebuild it, which directly aligns with the answer's description of dropping and recreating the relation. The text also supports the use for rebuilding incremental models, though changing materialization strategies is not explicitly mentioned but is consistent with the function."

<front>

What is the primary function of the `--full-refresh` flag when executing `dbt run`?

<back>

It forces dbt to drop the existing relation in the database and recreate it from scratch.

This is commonly used when changing materialization strategies (e.g., view to table) or rebuilding incremental models entirely.
