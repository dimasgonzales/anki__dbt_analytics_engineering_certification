  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly supports using sources for referencing raw data, which aligns with the answer's use of the 'source' function. The text indicates that sources are recommended for raw data to manage dependencies and configuration, consistent with the benefits stated in the answer."

<front>

What function is used to reference raw database tables in dbt models, and why is it preferred over hard-coding schema names?

<back>

Use the `{{ source('source_name', 'table_name') }}` function. 

This is preferred because it adds the table to the **DAG** (dependency graph), allows for **freshness** checks, and enables centralized configuration of database locations in `.yml` files.
