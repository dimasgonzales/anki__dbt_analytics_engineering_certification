<front>

You need to create a table that lists every single date between 2020 and 2025 to join against your sales data (a "date spine"). How should you accomplish this in dbt without writing complex recursive SQL?

<back>

Import the `dbt_utils` package and use the `date_spine` macro.

```sql
{{ dbt_utils.date_spine(
    datepart="day",
    start_date="cast('2020-01-01' as date)",
    end_date="cast('2025-01-01' as date)"
   )
}}
```

</back>
