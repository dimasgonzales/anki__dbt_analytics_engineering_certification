<front>

You are building an Iceberg model and need to physically remove rows from the target table where the source indicates a deletion. How would you configure this?

</front>

<back>

Use the `merge` strategy and define a `delete_condition` in the configuration to handle the hard delete logic.
```yaml
config(
  table_type='iceberg',
  incremental_strategy='merge',
  unique_key='id',
  delete_condition="src.status = 'deleted'"
)
```

</back>
