  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that materializations in dbt determine the Data Definition Language (DDL) used for creating models and describes dbt's declarative approach using SELECT statements, which aligns with the answer's claim that dbt abstracts DDL away and wraps SELECT statements in appropriate DDL based on materialization."

How does dbt handle Data Definition Language (DDL) like `CREATE TABLE` or `CREATE VIEW`?

dbt abstracts DDL away from the analyst. You write a `SELECT` statement, and dbt wraps that query in the appropriate DDL based on the materialization configuration.

For example, if configured as a table, dbt compiles code similar to:
```sql
CREATE TABLE my_schema.my_model AS (
  SELECT ...
);
```
