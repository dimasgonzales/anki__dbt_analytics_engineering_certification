How does dbt handle Data Definition Language (DDL) like `CREATE TABLE` or `CREATE VIEW`?

dbt abstracts DDL away from the analyst. You write a `SELECT` statement, and dbt wraps that query in the appropriate DDL based on the materialization configuration.

For example, if configured as a table, dbt compiles code similar to:
```sql
CREATE TABLE my_schema.my_model AS (
  SELECT ...
);
```
