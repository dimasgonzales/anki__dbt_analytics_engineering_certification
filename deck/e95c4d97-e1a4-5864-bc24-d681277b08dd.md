<front>

When using the `log()` function in a dbt macro, what argument must be set to ensure the message appears in the CLI console (stdout)?

You must set `info=true`.

By default, the `info` argument is `false`, meaning messages are written only to the `dbt.log` file and are invisible in the terminal output.
