<front>

You migrate a project from dbt Core to the dbt Cloud CLI. Running `dbt deps` fails with an error pointing to the following configuration. What is the cause?
```yaml
packages:
  - local: ../internal_macros
```

</front>

---

<back>

The error is caused by the relative path `../internal_macros`. The dbt Cloud CLI execution environment cannot resolve relative paths outside the project root. You must host the package in a git repository and reference it via git URL instead.
