<front>

You have an incremental model that requires a composite primary key consisting of `order_id` and `country_code` to perform upserts correctly. How should you format the `unique_key` configuration?

<back>

You should format the key as a list (array) of strings rather than a single string. This ensures database compatibility.

Code Example:
```yaml
{{ config(
    materialized='incremental',
    unique_key=['order_id', 'country_code']
) }}
```
