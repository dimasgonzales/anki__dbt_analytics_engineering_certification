<front>

You are migrating a dbt Core project to the dbt Cloud CLI. Your `dbt deps` command fails with an error regarding a package defined with `local: ../internal_macros`. How should you resolve this?

</front>

<back>

You must replace the local path reference with a Git repository reference. Since the dbt Cloud CLI cannot resolve relative local paths, you should host the internal macros in a Git repository and reference the git URL.

```yaml
packages:
  - git: "https://github.com/org/internal_macros.git"
    version: 1.0.0
```

</back>
