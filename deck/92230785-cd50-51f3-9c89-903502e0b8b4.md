<front>

You need to create a boolean dimension named 'is_bulk' in your semantic model based on logic where the 'quantity' column is greater than 10. How would you configure this in YAML?

<back>

You must set the type to `categorical` and use the `expr` field to define the SQL logic.

```yaml
dimensions:
  - name: is_bulk
    type: categorical
    expr: case when quantity > 10 then true else false end
```

</back>
