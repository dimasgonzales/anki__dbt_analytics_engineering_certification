  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer accurately describes using a .dbtignore file in the root of a dbt project to ignore files, which is explicitly stated in the reference text."
  citation:
    quote: "You can create a .dbtignore file in the root of your dbt project to specify files that should be entirely ignored by dbt. The file behaves like a .gitignore file, using the same syntax. Files and subdirectories matching the pattern will not be read, parsed, or otherwise detected by dbt—as if they didn't exist."

You can create a .dbtignore file in the root of your dbt project to specify files that should be entirely ignored by dbt. The file behaves like a .gitignore file, using the same syntax. Files and subdirectories matching the pattern will not be read, parsed, or otherwise detected by dbt—as if they didn't exist.
