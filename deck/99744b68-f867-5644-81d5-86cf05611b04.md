<front>

You notice a colleague has created a new model that selects from `report_executive_dashboard`. Why is this an anti-pattern, and how should it be fixed?

<back>

Reporting models should be the 'leaves' (endpoints) of the DAG. Building on top of them creates brittle dependencies and often duplicates aggregation logic.

**Fix:** Extract the shared logic or data transformation from the report into an **upstream intermediate model**, then have both the dashboard and the new model reference that intermediate model.
