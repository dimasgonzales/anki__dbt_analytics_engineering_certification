<front>

If you inspect the `target/compiled` folder for a model that uses `{{ dbt_utils.star(...) }}`, what will the SQL look like?

</front>

<back>

The compiled SQL will contain a static, literal list of column names (e.g., `id, name, date`). It does not contain the Jinja macro code or a dynamic SQL function; the columns are resolved into text *before* the query is sent to the data warehouse.
