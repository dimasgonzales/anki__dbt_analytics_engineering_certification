  explanation: "The reference text does not contain specific information about how the `{{ dbt_utils.star(...) }}` macro is compiled into SQL in the `target/compiled` folder. While it mentions the directory's purpose, it lacks details on macro resolution or the static nature of compiled column lists."

<front>

If you inspect the `target/compiled` folder for a model that uses `{{ dbt_utils.star(...) }}`, what will the SQL look like?

<back>

The compiled SQL will contain a static, literal list of column names (e.g., `id, name, date`). It does not contain the Jinja macro code or a dynamic SQL function; the columns are resolved into text *before* the query is sent to the data warehouse.
