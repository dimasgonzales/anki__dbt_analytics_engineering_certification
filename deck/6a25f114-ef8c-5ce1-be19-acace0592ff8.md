<front>

Which two configuration keys are required within a source `freshness` block to define the timing thresholds for alerts?

</front>

<back>

The keys are `warn_after` and `error_after`. Both require a `count` (integer) and a `period` (e.g., minute, hour, day) to function.

```yaml
freshness:
  warn_after: {count: 12, period: hour}
  error_after: {count: 24, period: hour}
```

</back>
