<front>

A developer notices that a dbt Cloud job is building tables into a schema named `dbt_cloud_pr_98765`. What does this indicate about the job type and its lifecycle?

</front>

<back>

This indicates it is a **Continuous Integration (CI) job** triggered by a Pull Request (likely PR #98765). The schema is ephemeral, meaning it exists only for the duration of the PR to test changes in isolation before being dropped.
