<front>

When defining model versions in a `schema.yml` file, which property must be set at the top level of the model configuration to designate the canonical version?

You must set the `latest_version` property.

This tells dbt which version to use when `ref('model_name')` is called without a specific version argument.

Example:
```yaml
models:
  - name: dim_customers
    latest_version: 2
    versions:
      - v: 1
      - v: 2
```

</back>
