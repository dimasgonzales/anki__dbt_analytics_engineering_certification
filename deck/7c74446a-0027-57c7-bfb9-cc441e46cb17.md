  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly mentions that using the 'hard_deletes' config with value 'new_record' is required to track deleted records, which aligns with the answer's claim about marking them as invalid in the snapshot."

What configuration must be added to a snapshot to ensure that rows physically deleted from the source are marked as invalid in the snapshot?

<back>

You must add `hard_deletes: 'new_record'` to the snapshot configuration. Without this, dbt defaults to ignoring source deletions, leaving the record active in the snapshot forever.
