  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that snapshots are executed using the 'dbt snapshot' command, supporting that part of the answer. However, it does not contain any information about 'dbt run' or its role in triggering snapshots, making it impossible to verify the claim that 'dbt run' does not trigger snapshots and is reserved for other tasks."

<back>

Snapshots are executed using the `dbt snapshot` command. They are **not** triggered by `dbt run`, which is reserved for building models, seeds, and tests.
