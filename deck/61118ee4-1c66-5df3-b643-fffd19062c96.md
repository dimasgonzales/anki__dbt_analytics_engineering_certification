  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The Reference Text discusses Jinja delimiters in the context of SQL generation, including examples and mentions of `{{ ... }}` and `{% ... %}` for whitespace control and quoting. However, it does not explicitly state the difference in output behavior between `{{ ... }}` as an expression delimiter that prints and `{% ... %}` as a statement delimiter that does not produce text output by default. While it implies `{{ ... }}` is used for outputting values in expressions, it lacks specific information to verify the claim about `{% ... %}`."

<front>

What is the primary difference between the Jinja delimiter `{{ ... }}` and `{% ... %}` regarding SQL generation?

<back>

`{{ ... }}` is an **Expression** delimiter that prints (outputs) the result into the compiled SQL. `{% ... %}` is a **Statement** delimiter used for control logic (like loops, conditions, or setting variables) and does not produce text output by default.
