<front>

In the dbt v1.9+ YAML definition standard for snapshots, which property is used to define the upstream dataset being snapshotted?

</front>

<back>

The `relation` property is used. It accepts a `ref()` or `source()` function call to identify the table or view dbt should snapshot, replacing the `SELECT *` logic found in legacy SQL snapshot files.
```yaml
snapshots:
  - name: orders_snapshot
    relation: source('jaffle_shop', 'orders')
```
