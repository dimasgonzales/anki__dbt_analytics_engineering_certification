<front>

Your incremental model runs daily, but you notice that source data arriving 1-2 days late is consistently missing from the final table. How should you modify the incremental filter logic to fix this?

</front>

<back>

Implement a lookback window in your filter logic. Instead of filtering strictly on the max timestamp, subtract an interval to capture and update late-arriving data:
```sql
where updated_at > (select max(updated_at) - interval '3 days' from {{ this }})
```

</back>
