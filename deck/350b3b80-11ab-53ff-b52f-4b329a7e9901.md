<front>

If you delete a `.sql` model file from your dbt project, what happens to the corresponding table or view in the data warehouse when you next run dbt?

dbt manages the creation and update of objects but does not perform "garbage collection." You must manually execute a `DROP` statement in your warehouse to remove the orphaned object.
