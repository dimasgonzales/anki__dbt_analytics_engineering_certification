  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly states that dbt does not automatically remove deleted models from the data warehouse, confirming that the object remains and manual action is needed."

<front>

If you delete a `.sql` model file from your dbt project, what happens to the corresponding table or view in the data warehouse when you next run dbt?

<back>

Nothing happens to the existing object; it remains in the database.

dbt manages the creation and update of objects but does not perform "garbage collection." You must manually execute a `DROP` statement in your warehouse to remove the orphaned object.
