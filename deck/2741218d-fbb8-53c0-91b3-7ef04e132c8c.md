<front>

You are using `materialized_view` and modify a configuration setting that requires a database update. You want dbt to attempt an `ALTER` statement rather than dropping and recreating the view. How should you configure this?

</front>

<back>

You should set `on_configuration_change='apply'`.

This tells dbt to attempt to reconcile the configuration drift by applying changes to the existing object, which preserves the object and is often faster than a full recreation.
