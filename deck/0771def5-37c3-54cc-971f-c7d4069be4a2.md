<front>

Your pipeline runs daily at 8 AM. You want to ensure the job fails immediately if the source table `orders` hasn't been updated within the last 24 hours. How do you configure and execute this?

<back>

Define an `error_after` threshold in the source configuration and run the freshness check command.

YAML:
```yaml
freshness:
  error_after: {count: 24, period: hour}
```

Command:
```bash
dbt source freshness
```
