  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly supports the method described: using a doc block named `__overview__` to customize the main overview, and `__[project_name]__` for package-specific overviews, which aligns with the answer's mention of `__[package name]__`."
  citation:
    quote: "You can set different overviews for each dbt project/package included in your documentation site by creating a docs block named `__[project_name]__`."

How do you customize the "overview" section generated for your dbt documentation site? How can you do this for specific packages within your project?

By supplying a doc block called `__overview__`. You can similarly specify a special `__[package name]__` doc block to overwrite a package's overview.
