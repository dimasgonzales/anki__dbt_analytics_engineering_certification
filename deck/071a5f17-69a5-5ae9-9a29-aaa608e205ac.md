<front>

You are setting up a new dbt project. You want to ensure that your atomic cleaning layers are treated as virtual logic, while your final business-critical models are physically stored for performance. How would you configure this in `dbt_project.yml`?

<back>

Configure the `staging` folder to materialize as **views** and the `marts` (or `core`) folder to materialize as **tables**.

Example:
```yaml
models:
  my_project:
    staging:
      +materialized: view
    marts:
      +materialized: table
```

</back>
