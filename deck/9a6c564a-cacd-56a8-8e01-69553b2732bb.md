  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly supports documenting custom macros in a .yml file with a top-level 'macros:' key. For instance, it recommends creating a '_macros.yml' for macro documentation and provides an example in 'macros/properties.yml' that shows the 'macros:' key as the top-level element for listing macros."

In which file type and under what top-level key should custom macros be documented?

<back>

Macros should be documented in a `.yml` file (e.g., `macros.yml` or `schema.yml`) under the top-level `macros:` key.
