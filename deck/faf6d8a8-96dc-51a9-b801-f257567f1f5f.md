  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that the '+' prefix is used to demarcate between folder names and configurations, which directly aligns with the answer's explanation that it distinguishes configuration keys from directory names."

<front>

In `dbt_project.yml`, why must configuration keys nested under resource paths be prefixed with a plus sign (+)?

<back>

The `+` prefix distinguishes **configuration keys** from **directory names**. Without the prefix, dbt interprets the key as a subdirectory within the project structure rather than a setting to apply.

Example:
```yaml
models:
  my_folder:
    +enabled: true  # Config
    sub_folder:     # Directory
```

</back>
