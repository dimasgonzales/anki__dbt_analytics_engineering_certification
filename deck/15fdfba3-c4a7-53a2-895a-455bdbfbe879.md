<front>

You are running `dbt build`. You want to ensure a downstream model attempts to run even if an upstream model's unique test fails. How do you configure this?

</front>

<back>

You must configure the upstream test with a severity of `warn`. This allows the test to pass (with a warning) rather than returning an error that triggers the blocking behavior.

```yaml
tests:
  - unique:
      config:
        severity: warn
```

</back>
