<front>

What are the two primary Jinja functions used to define dependencies and build the DAG in dbt?

<back>

1. `{{ ref() }}`: References other models within the same dbt project.
2. `{{ source() }}`: References raw data tables defined in `src_*.yml` files.

These functions allow dbt to determine the correct execution order for all models.
