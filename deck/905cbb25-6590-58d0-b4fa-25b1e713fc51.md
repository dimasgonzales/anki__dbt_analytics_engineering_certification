<front>

You need to apply a Row Access Policy to a Snowflake table immediately after it is built. Why would relying on the `grants` config fail, and what should you use instead?

<back>

The `grants` config only abstracts standard DCL (Data Control Language) like `GRANT/REVOKE`. It does not support advanced DDL like `ALTER TABLE... ADD ROW ACCESS POLICY`.

You should use a **`post-hook`**:
```sql
{{ config(
    post_hook = "alter table {{ this }} add row access policy..."
) }}
```

</back>
