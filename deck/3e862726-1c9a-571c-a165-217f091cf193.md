What specific format is required for the `version` key defined in the `dbt_project.yml` file?

<back>

The project version must be defined using **semantic versioning** (e.g., `1.0.0`).

This creates the metadata version for the project artifact itself and is distinct from the `require-dbt-version` configuration.
