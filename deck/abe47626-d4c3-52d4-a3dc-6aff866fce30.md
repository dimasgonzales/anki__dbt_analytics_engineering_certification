<front>

You have `latest_version: 2` configured for a model, but you have also defined a `v: 3` in the YAML.

What is the primary benefit of defining v3 this way regarding downstream dependencies?

<back>

It allows you to test v3 as a **prerelease** without breaking production pipelines.

Downstream models using unpinned references `ref('model')` will continue to use the stable v2 (`latest`), while you can target v3 specifically for testing using `ref('model', v=3)`.
