<front>

You have a high-traffic dashboard requiring low-latency query performance. You want to offload the data refresh schedule to the database's auto-refresh capabilities rather than managing batch schedules in dbt. Which materialization should you choose?

</front>

<back>

Use `materialized_view`. This provides the query performance of a table (since data is pre-computed) while allowing the database to handle data freshness automatically, distinguishing it from a standard `table` where dbt must explicitly run to update the data.
