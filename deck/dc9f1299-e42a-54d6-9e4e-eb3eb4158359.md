<front>

You want to run a specific subset of models based on their business area (e.g., 'finance'). How does dbt use node metadata to enable this?

<back>

dbt uses the `tags` metadata field associated with each node.

By assigning tags in the model config, you can select specific subsets for execution using the `--select` flag.

Example:
```bash
dbt run --select tag:finance
```
