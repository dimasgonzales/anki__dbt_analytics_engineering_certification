<front>

Model A is in the `finance` group and has `access: private`. Model B is in the `risk` group. What happens if Model B attempts to `ref()` Model A?

<back>

dbt will raise a compilation error. 

Because Model A is `private`, it is only visible to models within the `finance` group. Since Model B belongs to the `risk` group, it is not permitted to reference Model A.
