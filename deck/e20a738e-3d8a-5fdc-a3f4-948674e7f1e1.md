  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly states that the `{{ debug() }}` macro is intended only for development and opens an iPython debugger, which implies halting execution for manual interaction, consistent with the answer's claim about awaiting user input via CLI and causing issues in production."
  citation:
    quote: "The `{{ debug() }}` macro will open an iPython debugger in the context of a compiled dbt macro. Do not deploy code to production that uses the `debug` macro."

<front>

Why is the `{{ debug() }}` macro considered strictly a "development-only" tool?

<back>

Because it halts execution to await manual user input via the CLI. If included in a production environment (such as an automated schedule or CI/CD pipeline), it will cause the job to hang indefinitely or until it times out.
