  explanation: "The reference text discusses general differences between dbt and stored procedures, such as DAG and declarative approaches, but does not mention parameters, variables (`vars`), `dbt_project.yml`, or CLI overrides for replicating stored procedure parameters in dbt."

<front>

How are stored procedure parameters (arguments) typically replicated in a dbt project?

Parameters are replicated using variables (`vars`). You define default values in `dbt_project.yml` and reference them in models using `{{ var('variable_name') }}`. These values can then be overridden at runtime via the CLI.
