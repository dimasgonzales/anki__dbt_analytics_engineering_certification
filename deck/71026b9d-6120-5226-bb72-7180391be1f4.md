<front>

You added the following configuration to `dbt_project.yml`, but the `employees` seed is still enabled. What is the likely cause?
```yaml
seeds:
  employees:
    +enabled: false
```

</front>

<back>

The configuration is missing the **project name** level. dbt requires resource configurations in `dbt_project.yml` to follow the scope of `seeds: <project_name>: <seed_name>:`.
