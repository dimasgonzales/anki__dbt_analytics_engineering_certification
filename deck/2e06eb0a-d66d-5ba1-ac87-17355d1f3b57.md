<front>

You are working in a downstream dbt project and attempt to reference a model from an upstream project using `ref('upstream_model')`. You receive a dependency error even though the package is installed. What is the most likely cause?

</front>

<back>

The upstream model has not been configured with `access: public`. You need to update the upstream project's YAML configuration to expose that specific model as part of its public interface.

```yaml
models:
  - name: upstream_model
    access: public
```

</back>
