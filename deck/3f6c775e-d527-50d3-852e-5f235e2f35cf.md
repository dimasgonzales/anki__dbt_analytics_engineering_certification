  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text only mentions the 'Latest' release track and 'Latest Fusion' for the dbt Fusion Engine, but does not list or describe 'Compatible' and 'Extended' tracks, nor does it specify what the 'Extended' track provides. The text is insufficient to verify the answer."
