<front>

In `dbt_project.yml`, how do you apply a configuration like `target_schema` to a specific subdirectory of snapshots?

<back>

Nest the subdirectory name under the `snapshots:` key and the project name, then use the `+` prefix for the configuration key. This ensures the config applies only to snapshots within that folder hierarchy.
```yaml
snapshots:
  my_project:
    finance_folder:
      +target_schema: finance_snapshots
```

</back>
