<front>

You are configuring a snapshot for a source table that does not have a reliable `updated_at` timestamp column. Which strategy should you use and what key configuration is required?

<back>

You should use the `check` strategy. Instead of relying on a timestamp, you must configure `check_cols` to list the specific columns dbt should compare to detect changes.
```yaml
config:
  strategy: check
  check_cols: ['status', 'order_value']
```

</back>
