<front>

What is the behavior of the `ref()` function when referencing a model configured with `access: private`?

<back>

The `ref()` function will only work if the downstream model (the one calling ref) is in the **same group** as the referenced private model. If the downstream model is in a different group, dbt blocks the dependency and raises an error.
