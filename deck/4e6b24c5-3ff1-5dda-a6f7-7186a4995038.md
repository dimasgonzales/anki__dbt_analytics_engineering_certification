  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly states that a model with a private access modifier is only referenceable by models within the same group, which directly supports the answer's claim that the `ref()` function only works if the downstream model is in the same group as the private model. The text implies that referencing from a different group would result in failure, aligning with the answer's mention of dbt blocking and raising an error."

<front>

What is the behavior of the `ref()` function when referencing a model configured with `access: private`?

<back>

The `ref()` function will only work if the downstream model (the one calling ref) is in the **same group** as the referenced private model. If the downstream model is in a different group, dbt blocks the dependency and raises an error.
