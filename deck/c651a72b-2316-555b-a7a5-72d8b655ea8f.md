  explanation: "The Reference Text confirms that dbt Catalog provides visualization and visibility into lineage, and dbt Scheduler provides orchestration through scheduled jobs, directly supporting the Answer's distinction."

<front>

Regarding downstream dependencies, what is the difference between the role of the **dbt Catalog** and the **dbt Scheduler**?

<back>

The **dbt Catalog** provides **Visualization** (showing the lineage graph to understand impact and data flow), while the **dbt Scheduler** provides **Orchestration** (executing jobs to ensure data timeliness). One creates *visibility*; the other drives *action*.
