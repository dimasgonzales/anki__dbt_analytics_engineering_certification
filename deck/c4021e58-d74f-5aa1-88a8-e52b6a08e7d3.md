  explanation: "The reference text describes dbt running a SQL query to check source freshness, such as using a 'select max(...)' query, but it does not explicitly mention two calculation methods (e.g., inspecting warehouse metadata as a default method) or the 'loaded_at_field' configuration key that forces a query strategy. The text lacks sufficient information to verify the full answer."

<front>

What are the two methods dbt uses to calculate source freshness, and which configuration key forces a SQL query strategy?

</front>

<back>

dbt calculates freshness by either inspecting warehouse metadata (default/faster) or running a `select max(...)` query on a specific column. Defining the `loaded_at_field` in the source configuration forces dbt to run the query strategy instead of using metadata.
