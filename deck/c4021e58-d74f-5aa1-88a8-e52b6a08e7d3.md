<front>

What are the two methods dbt uses to calculate source freshness, and which configuration key forces a SQL query strategy?

dbt calculates freshness by either inspecting warehouse metadata (default/faster) or running a `select max(...)` query on a specific column. Defining the `loaded_at_field` in the source configuration forces dbt to run the query strategy instead of using metadata.
