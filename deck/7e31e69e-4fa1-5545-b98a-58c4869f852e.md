  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that profiles are stored separately from dbt projects to prevent credentials from being checked into version control, which directly supports the answer's reason. Additionally, it confirms that profiles.yml is often located in the user's home directory (~/.dbt/) outside the project, aligning with the location details provided in the answer."

Why does dbt store database credentials in `profiles.yml` rather than `dbt_project.yml`?

To prevent sensitive credentials from being checked into version control.

`profiles.yml` usually lives in the user's home directory (`~/.dbt/`) outside the git repository, while `dbt_project.yml` is part of the project source code.
