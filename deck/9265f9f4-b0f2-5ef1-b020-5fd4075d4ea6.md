<front>

You have defined an exposure in `models/exposures.yaml` and can see it in your lineage graph, but the dashboard data is not updating automatically after the dbt job finishes. What is the likely cause?

<back>

You have achieved **visualization** by defining the YAML, but you have not enabled **orchestration**. Defining the YAML creates the node in the graph, but specific dbt Cloud environment configuration is required to trigger the actual data refresh action.
