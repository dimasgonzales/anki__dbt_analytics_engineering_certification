  verdict: CONTRADICTED
  explanation: "The answer incorrectly states that the `+model` operator selects only immediate upstream dependencies. The reference text specifies that when placed before a model, the `+` operator includes all ancestors (upstream dependencies), not just immediate ones, contradicting the answer."

<front>

What is the difference between the `+model` operator and the `@model` operator in dbt node selection?

<back>

The `+model` operator selects the model and its immediate upstream dependencies.

The `@model` operator selects the model, its parents, its children, AND the parents of its children. This is often used to ensure all dependencies required to build downstream children are present.
