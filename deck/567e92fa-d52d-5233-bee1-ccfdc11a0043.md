<front>

You are writing a new model `final_revenue`. It needs to select data from an existing model named `stg_payments`. How should you write the `FROM` clause?

</front>

<back>

You should use the `ref()` function:

```sql
select * from {{ ref('stg_payments') }}
```

Using the hardcoded table name (e.g., `analytics.stg_payments`) breaks the lineage graph and may fail if the schema changes between environments.
