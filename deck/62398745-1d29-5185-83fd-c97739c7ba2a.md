  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that `incremental_predicates` are used for performance optimization in incremental models, aligning with the answer's claim about enabling predicate pushdown to limit data scans, particularly in the context of Iceberg merge operations as indicated in the text."
  citation:
    quote: "`incremental_predicates` is an advanced use of incremental models, where data volume is large enough to justify additional investments in performance."

<front>

What is the primary purpose of using `incremental_predicates` in a dbt-athena Iceberg model?

<back>

`incremental_predicates` are used for performance optimization. They enable predicate pushdown to limit the amount of data scanned in the target table during the `merge` operation.
