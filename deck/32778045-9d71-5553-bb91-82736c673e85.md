  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that the schema parameter in profiles.yml is used in dbt Core for setting the target schema per user, which supports the answer's claim about Development Environment Isolation to prevent overwriting."

How does dbt ensure that multiple developers working on the same project do not overwrite each other's tables in the data warehouse?

dbt uses **Development Environment Isolation** via the `target.schema` configuration in `profiles.yml`. By default, developers configure a unique schema (e.g., `dbt_jdoe`) in their local profile, ensuring their `dbt run` builds models in their private schema without affecting production or other teammates.
