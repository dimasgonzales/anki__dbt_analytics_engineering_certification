How does dbt ensure that multiple developers working on the same project do not overwrite each other's tables in the data warehouse?

dbt uses **Development Environment Isolation** via the `target.schema` configuration in `profiles.yml`. By default, developers configure a unique schema (e.g., `dbt_jdoe`) in their local profile, ensuring their `dbt run` builds models in their private schema without affecting production or other teammates.
