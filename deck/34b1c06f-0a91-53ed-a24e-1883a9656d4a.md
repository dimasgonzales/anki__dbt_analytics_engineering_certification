<front>

In a multi-step dbt Cloud job, what happens to subsequent steps if a manual command step returns a non-zero exit code?

<back>

Subsequent steps are **skipped** and the job terminates immediately with a status of 'Error'.

dbt Cloud stops the execution flow immediately upon a hard failure in a manual command step (e.g., if `dbt run` fails, `dbt test` in the next step will not execute).
