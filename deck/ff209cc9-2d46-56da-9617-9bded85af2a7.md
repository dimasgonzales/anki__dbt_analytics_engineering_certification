<front>

You have a complex SQL query meant for a one-off data audit that requires Jinja compilation (refs) but should not be materialized as a table in the warehouse. How would you handle this in dbt?

</front>

<back>

Save the SQL file in the `analyses` folder. dbt will compile the Jinja code when you run `dbt compile`, but it will **not** run the query or create objects in the database.
