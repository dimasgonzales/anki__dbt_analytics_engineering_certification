<front>

You have added a new index to an existing `materialized_view` model. You want dbt to apply this change (alter the view) during the next run without dropping and recreating the view or failing. What config should you add?

</front>

---

<back>

Set `on_configuration_change` to `'apply'`.

```sql
{{ config(
    materialized='materialized_view',
    on_configuration_change='apply',
    indexes=[{'columns': ['new_column']}]
) }}
```
This instructs dbt to attempt to update the object in place.
