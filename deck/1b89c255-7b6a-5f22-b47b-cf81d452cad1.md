<front>

What are the three mechanisms available in dbt Cloud to trigger a deployment job?

<back>

1. **Schedule:** Runs at specific times (e.g., via cron syntax).
2. **API:** Triggered programmatically via the dbt Cloud API (often used by external orchestrators like Airflow).
3. **Run on completion:** Triggered automatically when a different, specified job finishes successfully.
