<front>

You are building a monitoring script to audit dbt executions. Which field in the log structure should you use to group all events belonging to a single specific command run?

</front>

<back>

You should use the `invocation_id` found within the `info` key.

Example:
```json
"info": {
  "invocation_id": "206b4e61-uuid-number..."
}
```
This ID remains constant for the entire duration of a specific CLI command execution.
