<front>

You run `dbt debug` and receive an error: `Could not find profile named 'jaffle_shops'`. Your `profiles.yml` defines a profile named `jaffle_shop`. What is the cause and fix?

<back>

There is a mismatch between the project configuration and the profile definition. The `profile` key in `dbt_project.yml` is likely set to the plural `jaffle_shops`, but the `profiles.yml` uses the singular `jaffle_shop`. Update one to match the other.
