<front>

You have defined a macro `grant_select_on_schemas` to handle permissioning. You need to execute this immediately without running the entire project. Which command should you use?

</front>

<back>

Run the following command:
```bash
dbt run-operation grant_select_on_schemas
```
This executes the macro directly as an operation, bypassing the model building process associated with `dbt run`.
