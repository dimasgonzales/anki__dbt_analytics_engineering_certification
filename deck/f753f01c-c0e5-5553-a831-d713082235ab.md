  explanation: "The reference text only lists 'on-run-start & on-run-end' as configuration names with hyperlinks to external guides or definitions, but does not provide any descriptive content about their definition in dbt_project.yml, functionality, or execution behavior. Therefore, there is insufficient information to support or contradict the answer."

<front>

<back>

They are hooks defined in `dbt_project.yml` that execute a list of SQL statements at the very beginning and very end of a dbt invocation (e.g., during a `dbt run` or `dbt test`), rather than before/after individual models.
