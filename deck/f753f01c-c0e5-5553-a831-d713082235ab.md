  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that on-run-start is executed at the start of various dbt operations, including run and test, which supports the answer's claim that these hooks operate at the beginning and end of dbt invocations like 'dbt run' or 'dbt test', rather than before/after individual models. However, details like being defined in 'dbt_project.yml' or executing SQL statements are not found but not contradicted."

What are the `on-run-start` and `on-run-end` configurations in dbt?

<back>

They are hooks defined in `dbt_project.yml` that execute a list of SQL statements at the very beginning and very end of a dbt invocation (e.g., during a `dbt run` or `dbt test`), rather than before/after individual models.
