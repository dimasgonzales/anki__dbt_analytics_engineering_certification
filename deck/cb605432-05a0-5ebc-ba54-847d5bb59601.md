  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Answer correctly identifies that `dbt clone` creates physical objects in the target schema, while `--defer` does not create new objects for unmodified models, only resolving `ref()` calls to existing ones, as explicitly detailed in the Reference Text."
  citation:
    quote: "For defer: 'Doesn't create any objects itself, but dbt might create objects in the target schema if they’ve changed from those in the source schema.' For clone: 'Copies objects from source schema to target schema in the data warehouse, which are persisted after operation is finished.'"

<front>

What is the primary difference between using `dbt clone` and the `--defer` flag regarding object creation?

<back>

`dbt clone` is an **eager** operation that creates actual physical objects (clones or views) in the target schema. 

`--defer` is a **lazy** operation that resolves `ref()` calls to point to existing production objects without creating new objects for unmodified models.
