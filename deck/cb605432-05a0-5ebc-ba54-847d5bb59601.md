<front>

What is the primary difference between using `dbt clone` and the `--defer` flag regarding object creation?

<back>

`dbt clone` is an **eager** operation that creates actual physical objects (clones or views) in the target schema. 

`--defer` is a **lazy** operation that resolves `ref()` calls to point to existing production objects without creating new objects for unmodified models.
