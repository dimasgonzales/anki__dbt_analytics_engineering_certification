What specific changes to a versioned model's contract are considered 'breaking changes' by dbt?

</front>

<back>

Breaking changes occur when you:
1. **Remove** an existing column.
2. **Change** a column's data type.
3. **Remove** a constraint (e.g., enforcing `not_null`).

Note: Adding new columns or constraints is considered 'additive' (non-breaking).
