  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer accurately identifies breaking changes as per the reference text, which includes removing columns, changing data types, and removing or modifying constraints. The note on additive changes is also supported by the context that adding new columns is non-breaking."

What specific changes to a versioned model's contract are considered 'breaking changes' by dbt?

<back>

Breaking changes occur when you:
1. **Remove** an existing column.
2. **Change** a column's data type.
3. **Remove** a constraint (e.g., enforcing `not_null`).

Note: Adding new columns or constraints is considered 'additive' (non-breaking).
