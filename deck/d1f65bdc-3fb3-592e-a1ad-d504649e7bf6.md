  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer correctly states that dbt uses file extensions to distinguish models and seeds, which is explicitly confirmed in the reference text when explaining how co-location works with the same directory."
  citation:
    quote: "Note: this works because dbt is looking for different file types for seeds (`.csv` files) and models (`.sql` files)."

<front>

If `model-paths` and `seed-paths` are configured to point to the same directory, how does dbt determine which files are models and which are seeds?

<back>

dbt distinguishes resources based on **file extensions**. Within the target directory, dbt parses `.sql` files as models and `.csv` files as seeds.
