<front>

You are trying to preview a model in the dbt Cloud IDE using the following code:
`SELECT * FROM {{ ref('table') }} {{ get_custom_limit() }}`

The preview fails to apply your custom limit. What is the likely cause?

<back>

The dbt Cloud IDE cannot parse a limit clause derived dynamically from a **macro** for the Preview feature. To override the default IDE safety limit, the `LIMIT` clause must be written explicitly in the SQL (e.g., `LIMIT 100`).
