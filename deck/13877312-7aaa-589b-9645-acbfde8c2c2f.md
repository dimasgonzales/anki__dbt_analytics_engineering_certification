<front>

You attempt to execute `dbt run` and receive the error: `dbt_project.yml not found`. What is the likely cause and how do you fix it?

</front>

<back>

You are likely running the command from the wrong directory (e.g., a subdirectory like `/models` or outside the project entirely).

To fix this, navigate to the root directory of your project where the configuration file exists:
```bash
cd path/to/my_project
dbt run
```

</back>
