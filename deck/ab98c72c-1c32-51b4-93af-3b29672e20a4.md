What is the purpose of the `state:modified` selector, and what flag is required to use it?

<back>

The `state:modified` selector identifies resources (models, tests, seeds) that have changed compared to a previous project state. To use it, you must provide the `--state` flag pointing to a directory containing a reference manifest (e.g., `manifest.json` from a production run).

```bash
dbt list --select state:modified --state path/to/artifacts
```
