What is the difference between deferring to a 'Job' versus an 'Environment' in the dbt Cloud 'Compare changes against' setting?

Deferring to a **Job** uses artifacts from the last successful run of that *specific* job definition. Deferring to an **Environment** uses the artifacts from the last successful run of *any* job within that environment.

Deferring to the Environment is generally recommended as it provides the most up-to-date representation of the project's production state.
