  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text from deployment-jobs/rank_1.md explicitly describes deferral to a job as using the last successful run of that specific job, and deferral to an environment as using the last successful deploy job run in the environment, considering all jobs, which aligns with the Answer's differentiation and recommendation."
  citation:
    quote: "Deferral to a job compares state against the project code that was run in the deferred job's last successful run. While deferral to an environment is more efficient as dbt will compare against the project representation (which is stored in the `manifest.json`) of the last successful deploy job run that executed in the deferred environment. By considering *all* deploy jobs that run in the deferred environment, dbt will get a more accurate, latest project..."

What is the difference between deferring to a 'Job' versus an 'Environment' in the dbt Cloud 'Compare changes against' setting?

Deferring to a **Job** uses artifacts from the last successful run of that *specific* job definition. Deferring to an **Environment** uses the artifacts from the last successful run of *any* job within that environment.

Deferring to the Environment is generally recommended as it provides the most up-to-date representation of the project's production state.
