What is the purpose of the `relationships` test in dbt and what two arguments are mandatory for its configuration?

<back>

The `relationships` test validates referential integrity (similar to a Foreign Key). It requires:
1. `to`: The parent model being referenced (usually via `ref()`).
2. `field`: The column name in the parent model to match against.
