<front>

Review the following Python model code. Why will this model fail to materialize a table in the warehouse?

```python
def model(dbt, session):
    df = dbt.ref("stg_orders")
    df = df[df['amount'] > 100]
    print(df)
```

</front>

<back>

The model fails because it does not **return** the dataframe. 

dbt Python models require a `return df` statement at the end of the function so the adapter knows what data to materialize into the target table.
