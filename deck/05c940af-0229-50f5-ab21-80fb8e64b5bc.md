<front>

You change a model's materialization from `view` to `table` in the code, but `dbt run` fails with a database error stating the relation already exists. How do you resolve this?

<back>

Run the command with the `--full-refresh` flag:

```bash
dbt run --full-refresh
```

This forces dbt to drop the existing view before creating the new table, resolving type mismatch errors between materializations.
