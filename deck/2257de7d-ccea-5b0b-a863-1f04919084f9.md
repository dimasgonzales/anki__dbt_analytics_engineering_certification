<front>

A user assigned the 'Developer' role can view job history in the Staging environment but receives an error when trying to manually trigger a run. What is the likely cause?

<back>

The user likely lacks **Write access** specifically for the **Staging** environment type. Since the Developer role is read-only by default, the admin must update the user's license permissions to explicitly include Write access for Staging.
