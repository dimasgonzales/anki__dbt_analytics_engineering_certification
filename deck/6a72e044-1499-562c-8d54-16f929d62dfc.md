<front>

You are documenting a Looker dashboard that relies on the `fct_orders` model and a metric named `revenue`. How would you format the YAML to link these assets to the exposure?

</front>

<back>

You would add a `depends_on` block to the exposure definition referencing both the model and the metric.
```yaml
depends_on:
  - ref('fct_orders')
  - metric('revenue')
```
This ensures the DAG accurately reflects that the dashboard consumes these specific resources.
