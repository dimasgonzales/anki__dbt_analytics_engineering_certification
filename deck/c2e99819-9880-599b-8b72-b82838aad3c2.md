<front>

Your physical warehouse table is named `2023_raw_orders_v3`, but you want to reference it simply as `orders` in your dbt models. How do you configure the source YAML?

</front>

<back>

Set the logical `name` to `orders` and use the `identifier` property to match the physical table name.
```yaml
tables:
  - name: orders
    identifier: 2023_raw_orders_v3
```

</back>
