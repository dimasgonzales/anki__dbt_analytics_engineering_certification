<front>

You want to group a specific seed file (`country_codes.csv`) in the same folder as the model that uses it (`dim_countries.sql`) inside the `models/` directory. How do you configure `dbt_project.yml`?

<back>

Add the `models` directory to the `seed-paths` list (in addition to the `model-paths` list).

```yaml
model-paths: ["models"]
seed-paths: ["seeds", "models"]
```
This tells dbt to scan the `models` directory for `.csv` files to treat as seeds.
