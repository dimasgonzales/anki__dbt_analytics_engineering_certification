  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly supports that dbt Hub packages require 'package' and 'version' keys, as shown in a YAML example. However, it does not provide any information or evidence regarding the required keys for Git packages in `packages.yml`; only command-line examples are mentioned for non-Hub packages. Therefore, the text does not contain enough information to verify the entire answer."

What are the required keys for defining a dbt Hub package versus a Git package in `packages.yml`?

For dbt Hub packages, you must use `package` and `version`. For Git packages, you must use `git` and `revision` (commit hash, tag, or branch name).

Example:
```yaml
packages:
  - package: dbt-labs/dbt_utils
    version: 1.0.0
  - git: https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils
    revision: 1.0.0
```
