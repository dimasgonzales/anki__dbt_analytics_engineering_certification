What are the required keys for defining a dbt Hub package versus a Git package in `packages.yml`?

For dbt Hub packages, you must use `package` and `version`. For Git packages, you must use `git` and `revision` (commit hash, tag, or branch name).

Example:
```yaml
packages:
  - package: dbt-labs/dbt_utils
    version: 1.0.0
  - git: https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils
    revision: 1.0.0
```
