<front>

Given the following `dbt_project.yml` snippet, why is the `finance` model folder failing to materialize as tables?

```yaml
models:
  my_project:
    finance:
      materialized: table
```

</front>

<back>

The configuration key `materialized` is missing the required `+` prefix. dbt interprets `materialized` as a subdirectory named "materialized" rather than a configuration setting.

**Correction:**
```yaml
+materialized: table
```

</back>
