<front>

You want to override the default logic for the built-in `incremental` materialization only within your specific dbt project. How would you accomplish this?

</front>

<back>

Create a new file in your local `macros/` directory (e.g., `macros/custom_incremental.sql`) and define a materialization with the same name:

```jinja
{% materialization incremental, default %}
  -- custom logic here
{% endmaterialization %}
```
Because **Local Project** scope has higher precedence than the **Global Project**, dbt will use your version.
