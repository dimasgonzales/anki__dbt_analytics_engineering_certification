  explanation: "The Reference Text does not contain information about overriding the 'incremental' materialization with the 'default' parameter or local project precedence. The provided snippets are about overriding with specific adapters and using incremental models, which are insufficient to verify the answer."

<front>

You want to override the default logic for the built-in `incremental` materialization only within your specific dbt project. How would you accomplish this?

</front>

<back>

Create a new file in your local `macros/` directory (e.g., `macros/custom_incremental.sql`) and define a materialization with the same name:

```jinja
{% materialization incremental, default %}
  -- custom logic here
{% endmaterialization %}
```
Because **Local Project** scope has higher precedence than the **Global Project**, dbt will use your version.

</back>
