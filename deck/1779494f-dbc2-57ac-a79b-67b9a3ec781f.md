  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly states that 'dbt run-operation' is used to invoke a macro, which supports the first part of the answer regarding the command name. However, there is no mention in the text about whether this command is categorized as a Read or Write command, so the categorization part cannot be verified."

<front>

Which CLI command is used to invoke a macro directly, and is it categorized as a Read or Write command?

</front>

<back>

The command is `dbt run-operation`. It is categorized as a **Write** command. Although it runs arbitrary SQL or Jinja, it is treated as a Write command because it is often used for maintenance tasks (like granting permissions) that change the database state.
