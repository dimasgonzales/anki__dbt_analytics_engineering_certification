  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that the default materialization for dbt models is views, which directly supports the answer that 'view' is the recommended default, even within the context of distributed packages as implied by general dbt model defaults."

Views are the lightest weight materialization. This gives the end-user the flexibility to override specific heavy-usage models to `table` or `incremental` in their own project configuration based on their performance requirements.
