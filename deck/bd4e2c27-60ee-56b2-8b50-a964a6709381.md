<front>

You have updated `dim_customers` and need to run it along with every downstream model that references it to ensure data consistency. What command should you use?

</front>

<back>

You should use the plus operator (`+`) at the end of the model name.

```bash
dbt run --select dim_customers+
```

This selects the model itself and all of its recursive children (downstream dependencies).
