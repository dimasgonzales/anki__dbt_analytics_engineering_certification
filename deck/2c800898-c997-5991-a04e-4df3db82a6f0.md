In `dbt_project.yml`, how do you ensure a seed configuration applies ONLY to the seeds in your current project and not to seeds imported from installed packages?

You must nest the configuration under your project name. Configurations placed directly under the `seeds:` key apply globally (including packages), whereas configs nested under `seeds: <project_name>:` apply only to your project's resources.

```yaml
seeds:
  my_project_name: # Scope to this project
    +schema: test
```

</back>
