<front>

In `dbt_project.yml`, how do you ensure a seed configuration applies ONLY to the seeds in your current project and not to seeds imported from installed packages?

<back>

You must nest the configuration under your project name. Configurations placed directly under the `seeds:` key apply globally (including packages), whereas configs nested under `seeds: <project_name>:` apply only to your project's resources.

```yaml
seeds:
  my_project_name: # Scope to this project
    +schema: test
```

</back>
