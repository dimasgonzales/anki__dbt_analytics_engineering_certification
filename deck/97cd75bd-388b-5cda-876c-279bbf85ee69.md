<front>

You are building a specific table model for Redshift that requires a `dist` key of `user_id`, which differs from the project default. How should you apply this configuration?

</front>

<back>

Apply the configuration using the `{{ config() }}` macro at the top of that specific model's SQL file. This ensures the specific DDL settings are applied only to this model.

Example:
```sql
{{
  config(
    materialized = 'table',
    dist = 'user_id'
  )
}}
select ...
```

</back>
