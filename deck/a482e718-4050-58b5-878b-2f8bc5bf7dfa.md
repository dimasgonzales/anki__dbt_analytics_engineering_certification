  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that 'dbt retry re-executes the last dbt command from the node point of failure,' which directly supports the core purpose of re-executing a failed job from the point of failure. However, the additional details in the answer about relying on artifacts and starting only from failed resources with downstream dependencies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text."

What is the specific purpose of the `dbt retry` command introduced in v1.6?

`dbt retry` allows you to re-execute a failed job starting **only from the resources that failed** (and their downstream dependencies).

It relies on the artifacts from the previous run to determine where to resume execution.
