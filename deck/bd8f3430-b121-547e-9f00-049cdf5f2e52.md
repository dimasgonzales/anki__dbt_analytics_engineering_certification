You are creating a CI step to clone modified models using `dbt clone --select state:modified`. How do you prevent this command from failing on **new** models created in the current PR?

Intersect the selection with `state:old`. New models defined in the PR do not exist in the production manifest, so they cannot be cloned. Adding `state:old` filters them out.

```bash
dbt clone --select state:modified,state:old
```
