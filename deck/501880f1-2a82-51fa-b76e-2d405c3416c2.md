<front>

You are configuring a 'Slim CI' job to run `dbt build --select state:modified+`. To ensure dbt compares changes against the most recent production state regardless of which specific scheduled job ran last, what setting must you configure?

</front>

<back>

You must set **Compare changes against** to defer to the **Environment** (e.g., Production Environment).

This ensures dbt uses the `manifest.json` from the most recent successful execution in that environment, rather than being tied to a potentially stale artifact from a single specific job ID.
