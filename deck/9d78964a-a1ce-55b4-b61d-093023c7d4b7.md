  explanation: "The Reference Text does not explicitly address whether dbt Python models support 'view' materialization or if using 'view' would cause the run to fail. It only shows examples of Python models configured with 'table' and mentions 'view' in the context of SQL models, but lacks specific information about 'view' for Python."

    quote: "Configuring a model to materialize as a `table` is simple, and possible for both SQL and python models."

<front>

Given the following configuration in a Python model, what will happen during `dbt run`?
```python
def model(dbt, session):
    dbt.config(materialized = 'view')
    # ... logic
```

</front>

<back>

The run will **fail**.

dbt Python models do not support `view` materialization. You must change the configuration to `table` or `incremental`.
