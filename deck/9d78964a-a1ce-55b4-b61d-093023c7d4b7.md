  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer correctly states that dbt Python models do not support 'view' materialization, and the reference text explicitly confirms this by indicating that Python models only support 'table' and 'incremental' materializations, not views. This supports the answer's claim that the run will fail due to unsupported materialization."

<front>

Given the following configuration in a Python model, what will happen during `dbt run`?
```python
def model(dbt, session):
    dbt.config(materialized = 'view')
    # ... logic
```

</front>

<back>

The run will **fail**.

dbt Python models do not support `view` materialization. You must change the configuration to `table` or `incremental`.
