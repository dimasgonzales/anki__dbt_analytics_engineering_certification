What are the three distinct contexts in which dbt uses the concept of "versioning"?

1. **YAML Property Versions**: (e.g., `version: 2`) Instructs dbt how to parse a file.
2. **Project Versions**: (in `dbt_project.yml`) Metadata for the project artifact.
3. **Model Versions**: A governance feature for tracking data model evolution and contracts.
