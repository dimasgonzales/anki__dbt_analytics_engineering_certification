  explanation: "The reference text discusses cross-project lineage and dependencies in dbt Mesh but does not mention the specific configuration file 'dependencies.yml' or address whether listing a project establishes dependency immediately without SQL references. Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the answer."

<front>

Which configuration file is used to establish project-level lineage in dbt Mesh, and does it require active SQL references to take effect?

</front>

<back>

Project-level lineage is configured in `dependencies.yml`. Listing an upstream project here:
```yaml
projects:
  - name: upstream_project
```
Establishes a dependency edge in the Project Lineage graph immediately, even if no models are currently referenced using `{{ ref() }}` in the SQL code.
