  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text mentions the existence of `{{ this }}` in dbt and its use in incremental model logic, but it does not explicitly state that it refers to the currently existing target table or is used in subqueries to fetch high watermarks, as claimed in the answer. Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the answer."

<front>

How is the `{{ this }}` variable primarily used within the logic of an incremental model?

<back>

`{{ this }}` refers to the currently existing target table in the warehouse. It is used in subqueries to dynamically fetch the high watermark (e.g., the most recent timestamp) from the destination table to filter the source query for new data.
