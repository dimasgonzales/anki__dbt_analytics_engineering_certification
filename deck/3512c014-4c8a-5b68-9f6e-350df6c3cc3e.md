  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text from dag-failures/rank_2.md explicitly states that the '--exclude' flag is not supported in the Lineage tab of the dbt Cloud IDE, which directly supports the Answer's claim that exclusion syntax is not supported in the Visual Lineage selector."

<front>

Which node selection syntax is explicitly **not** supported within the dbt Cloud IDE Visual Lineage selector?

</front>

---

<back>

The **exclusion** syntax (e.g., `--exclude model_name` or `exclude:tag:daily`). While the visualizer supports standard selection syntax like `+model` or `tag:my_tag` to expand the graph, it does not support filtering nodes out.
