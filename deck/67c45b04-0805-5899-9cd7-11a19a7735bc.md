<front>

You want to create a reusable job in `selectors.yml` that runs all models with the tag `nightly` but specifically removes any models from the `snowplow` package. How would you structure this in YAML?

</front>

<back>

Use a `union` block containing the tag selection and an `exclude` block for the package.

```yaml
selectors:
  - name: nightly_job
    definition:
      union:
        - method: tag
          value: nightly
        - exclude:
            - method: package
              value: snowplow
```

</back>
