<front>

A developer writes `FROM analytics.stg_customers` in a new model instead of using `ref('stg_customers')`. What is the negative impact on the dbt run?

</front>

<back>

dbt cannot detect the dependency, so the lineage graph will be broken. dbt may attempt to run the new model *before* `stg_customers` is built or updated, potentially leading to errors or stale data.
