  explanation: "The reference text provides partial evidence supporting that local project configurations have higher precedence than imported packages, matching part of the answer. However, it does not mention the global project (dbt-core defaults) or the precedence of adapter-specific implementations within each scope. Therefore, there is insufficient information in the provided text to fully verify the entire answer."

<front>

What is the order of precedence dbt uses when resolving materializations (e.g., if `view` is defined in multiple places)?

<back>

dbt resolves materializations in this order (highest to lowest precedence):
1. **Local Project** (User-defined)
2. **Imported Packages**
3. **Global Project** (dbt-core defaults)

Within each scope, adapter-specific implementations take precedence over `default` ones.
