<front>

What is the order of precedence dbt uses when resolving materializations (e.g., if `view` is defined in multiple places)?

</front>

<back>

dbt resolves materializations in this order (highest to lowest precedence):
1. **Local Project** (User-defined)
2. **Imported Packages**
3. **Global Project** (dbt-core defaults)

Within each scope, adapter-specific implementations take precedence over `default` ones.
