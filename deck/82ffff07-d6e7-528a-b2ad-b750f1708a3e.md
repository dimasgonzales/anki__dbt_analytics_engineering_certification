  explanation: "The reference text indicates that 'defined_in' is an optional property that specifies the file name for a model version, with a default based on the convention '<model_name>_v<v>', allowing for customization and decoupling from the default file name."

What is the purpose of the `defined_in` property in a versioned model's configuration?

It allows you to decouple the logical version definition from the physical file name. 

By default, dbt looks for `<model>_v<v>.sql`, but `defined_in` lets you point a version to any specific file name (e.g., `legacy_code.sql`).
