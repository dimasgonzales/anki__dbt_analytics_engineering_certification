  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The Reference Text provides an example of using 'version' with a Hub package but does not mention the 'revision' key or explicitly describe the syntax rules for distinguishing between Hub and Git packages. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to verify the answer's claim about the specific error caused by mixing concepts."
  citation:
    quote: "Try updating the old version of the dbt_utils package in your packages.yml to the latest version found in the [dbt hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/dbt_utils/latest/):   ```   packages:     - package: dbt-labs/dbt_utils       version: xxx   ```"

<front>

You are reviewing a `packages.yml` file and see the following configuration that is causing an error. What is the problem?

```yaml
- package: dbt-labs/dbt_utils
  revision: 1.0.0
```

The syntax mixes Hub and Git concepts. Hub packages defined with the `package` key must use `version` (supporting semantic versioning). The `revision` key is reserved for packages defined with the `git` key.
