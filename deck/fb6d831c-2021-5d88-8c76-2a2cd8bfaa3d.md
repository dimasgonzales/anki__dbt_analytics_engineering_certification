What is the specific difference between the contents of `target/compiled/` and `target/run/` directories in a dbt project?

`target/compiled/` contains the `SELECT` statements with all Jinja compiled into pure SQL.

`target/run/` contains the actual DDL (Data Definition Language) statements executed against the warehouse, such as `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW...` wrapping the compiled SQL.
