<front>

You are troubleshooting a model with five chained CTEs that returns 0 rows, but no SQL error is thrown. How would you leverage dbt Fusion to locate the issue?

</front>

<back>

You would use the inline preview functionality to check the output of the first CTE, then the second, and so on.

```sql
WITH step_1 AS (...),
-- Preview output here to verify rows exist
step_2 AS (...)
```

This allows you to pinpoint exactly which transformation step filters out the data unexpectedly.
