  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text confirms that without a unique_key, most adapters result in append-only behavior, but it does not specify the default incremental strategy when unique_key is defined, nor does it mention dbt-postgres or compare it to other adapters like Snowflake."
  citation:
    quote: "If you don't specify a `unique_key`, most adapters will result in `append`-only behavior, which means dbt inserts all rows returned by the model's SQL into the preexisting target table without regard for whether the rows represent duplicates."

<front>

In dbt-postgres, what is the default incremental strategy when a `unique_key` is defined versus when it is not defined?

<back>

When a `unique_key` is defined, the default strategy is `delete+insert`. When no `unique_key` is defined, the default strategy is `append`. This differs from other adapters like Snowflake which typically default to `merge`.
