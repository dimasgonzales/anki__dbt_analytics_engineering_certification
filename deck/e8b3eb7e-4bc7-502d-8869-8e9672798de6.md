What is the `execute` variable used for/why is it needed?

<back>

When you execute a `dbt compile` or `dbt run` command, dbt proceeds in two distinct phases:
  

1. Parsing (generating the project manifest, DAG, etc). **No SQL is run during this phase**
2. Executing. **SQL is run during this phase**

Any Jinja that relies on a result being returned from the database will error during the parse phase because no SQL is run (yet). The Jinja `execute` vairable is set to `True` when dbt is in its "Execute" phase and SQL can be run. So, if you have Jinja code that requires that SQL be executed, wrap it in an `{% if execute %}` block so dbt doesn't error out when it gets to that block during the parsing phase.
