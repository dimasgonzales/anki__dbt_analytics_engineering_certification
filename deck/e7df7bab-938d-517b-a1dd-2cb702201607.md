  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that models with introspective macros like run_query() are introspective and that the rendering strategy switches from AOT to JIT for such models, aligning with the answer."

<front>

What happens to the rendering strategy when a dbt model includes an introspective macro like `run_query()`?

<back>

It switches from Ahead-of-Time (AOT) to Just-In-Time (JIT) rendering. Because the macro requires an active database query to generate SQL, dbt cannot fully compile the model until immediately before execution at runtime.
