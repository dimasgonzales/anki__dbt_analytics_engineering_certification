<front>

When defining columns for a specific version of a model, what syntax is used to inherit all top-level column definitions?

<back>

Use the `include` property with an asterisk string.

```yaml
columns:
  - include: "*"
```

This imports all top-level columns, which can then be modified using `exclude` or by overwriting specific column names.
