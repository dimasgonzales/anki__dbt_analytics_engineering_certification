  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text confirms the 'quoting' field with subfields database, schema, identifier and the default values for most adapters (true) and Snowflake (false), but it does not mention or provide evidence for the contexts when quoting happens (creating relations or resolving ref functions). Therefore, the answer cannot be fully verified."

<front>

What **dbt\_project.yml** field is used to specify whether dbt should quote databases, schemas, and identifiers? What is the default? In what contexts will quoting happen (if specified)?

</front>

<back>

```
quoting:
database: true | false
schema: true | false
identifier: true | false
```For most adapters, quoting is set to "true" across the board by default. For Snowflake, the default is "false", because quoting identifiers in Snowflake makes them case-sensitive, which is often not desireable.  
  
Identifiers will be quoted when:  

- creating relations
- resolving a "ref" function to a direct reference
