  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly supports the field 'quoting' with subfields 'database', 'schema', 'identifier' and the contexts where quoting is used (creating relations and resolving ref functions). However, it does not contain any information about the default values for these configurations, which are specified in the Answer. Therefore, while parts of the Answer are supported, the critical claim regarding defaults cannot be verified."
  citation:
    quote: "quoting: database: true | false schema: true | false identifier: true | false ... dbt uses this configuration when: * Creating relations (For example, tables or views) * Resolving a `ref()` function to a direct relation reference"

<front>

What **dbt\_project.yml** field is used to specify whether dbt should quote databases, schemas, and identifiers? What is the default? In what contexts will quoting happen (if specified)?

</front>

<back>

```
quoting:
database: true | false
schema: true | false
identifier: true | false
```For most adapters, quoting is set to "true" across the board by default. For Snowflake, the default is "false", because quoting identifiers in Snowflake makes them case-sensitive, which is often not desireable.  
  
Identifiers will be quoted when:  

- creating relations
- resolving a "ref" function to a direct reference
