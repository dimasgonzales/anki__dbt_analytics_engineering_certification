  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that the '@' operator includes all ancestors of all descendants of the selected model, which matches the answer's description of selecting the model, its children (descendants), and their parents/ancestors."
  citation:
    quote: "The '@' operator is similar to '+', but will also include *all ancestors of all descendants of the selected model*. This is useful in continuous integration environments where you want to build a model and all of its descendants, but the *ancestors* of those descendants might not exist in the schema yet. The '@' operator (which can only be placed at the front of the model name) will select as many degrees of ancestors (\"parents,\" \"grandparents,\" and so on) as is needed to successfully build all descendants of the specified model."

How do you select all of a node's children and the childrens' parents/ancestors?

<back>

The **@** operator, e.g. `dbt run --select @my_model` will select "my\_model", its children, and all parents/grandparents/etc. of those children.
