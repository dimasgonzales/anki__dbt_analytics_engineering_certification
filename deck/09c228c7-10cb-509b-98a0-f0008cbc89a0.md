<front>

You need to validate that the combination of `store_id` and `product_id` is unique in an existing model, but you are not allowed to modify the model's SQL to add a new column. How would you implement this test?

</front>

<back>

Define a generic `unique` test at the model level (or on an arbitrary column) and override the `column_name` argument with the SQL expression for the composite key.

```yaml
models:
  - name: inventory
    data_tests:
      - unique:
          config:
            column_name: "store_id || '-' || product_id"
```

</back>
