  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that dbt does not delete columns from the snapshot table when they are removed from the source, which directly supports the answer."

<front>

<back>

The column remains in the snapshot table. dbt handles schema evolution additively; it adds new columns found in the source but does not automatically delete columns from the snapshot table when they are removed from the source.
