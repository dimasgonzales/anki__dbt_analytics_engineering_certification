<front>

A column is dropped from the source table used by a dbt snapshot. What happens to this column in the snapshot table during the next execution?

</front>

<back>

The column remains in the snapshot table. dbt handles schema evolution additively; it adds new columns found in the source but does not automatically delete columns from the snapshot table when they are removed from the source.
