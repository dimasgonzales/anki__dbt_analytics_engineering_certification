<front>

You have a source `stripe` with 20 tables. You want to apply a standard 24-hour warning threshold to 19 of them, but one table (`payments`) requires a strict 1-hour warning threshold. How should you configure this in your `.yml` file?

</front>

<back>

Define the general 24-hour configuration at the `source` level to apply it to all tables by default. Then, under the `tables` list for the `payments` table, provide a specific `freshness` block to override the inherited values with the 1-hour threshold.
