  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that the 'dispatch' field in dbt_project.yml is used to override macro dispatch search behavior, describes the default search order as root project first then the specified package, and provides examples of use cases including shimming packages, which directly supports the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "If not specified, `dispatch` will look in your root project *first*, by default, and then look for implementations in the package named by `macro_namespace`."

What **dbt\_project.yml** field is used to override dbt's default macro dispatch search behavior? What is the default? What are some use cases?

**dispatch**. E.g.:

```
dispatch:
- macro\_namespace: packagename
search\_order: [packagename]
- macro\_namespace: packagename
search\_order: [packagename]
```The default behavior (since v0.21.1) is to look in the root project first, then in the package named by `macro_namespace`. This is what allows you to overwrite macros in dbt Core, dbt-utils, etc., with your own simply by defining a new macro with the same name in your local repo.  
  
Once use case for changing this behavior is to defer to a platform-specific implementation of a macro before defaulting to the general version, e.g.:  
```
dispatch:
- macro\_namespace: dbt\_utils
search\_order: ['spark\_utils', 'dbt\_utils']
```This will make dbt use Spark-specific implementations of dbt\_utils macros if they exist, falling back on the original dbt\_utils package if they don't.
