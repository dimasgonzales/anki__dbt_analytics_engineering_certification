What **dbt\_project.yml** field is used to override dbt's default macro dispatch search behavior? What is the default? What are some use cases?

**dispatch**. E.g.:

```
dispatch:
- macro\_namespace: packagename
search\_order: [packagename]
- macro\_namespace: packagename
search\_order: [packagename]
```The default behavior (since v0.21.1) is to look in the root project first, then in the package named by `macro_namespace`. This is what allows you to overwrite macros in dbt Core, dbt-utils, etc., with your own simply by defining a new macro with the same name in your local repo.  
  
Once use case for changing this behavior is to defer to a platform-specific implementation of a macro before defaulting to the general version, e.g.:  
```
dispatch:
- macro\_namespace: dbt\_utils
search\_order: ['spark\_utils', 'dbt\_utils']
```This will make dbt use Spark-specific implementations of dbt\_utils macros if they exist, falling back on the original dbt\_utils package if they don't.
