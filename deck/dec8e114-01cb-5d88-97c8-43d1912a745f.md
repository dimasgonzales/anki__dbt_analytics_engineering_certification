<front>

How do you configure a dbt test to trigger a hard error only when the number of failing rows exceeds a specific count, rather than the default of 0?

<back>

Use the `error_if` configuration. By default, dbt tests fail if > 0 rows are returned. Setting `error_if` allows you to define a specific condition (e.g., `"> 10"`) so the test only returns a non-zero exit code if that threshold is breached.
