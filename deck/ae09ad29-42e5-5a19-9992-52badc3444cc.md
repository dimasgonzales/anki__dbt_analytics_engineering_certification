How does dbt handle generic data types like `string` or `float` in a model contract?

<back>

dbt automatically converts (aliases) generic types to the corresponding data type for your specific data warehouse (e.g., `string` becomes `text` in Postgres). It generally ignores differences in precision or size (e.g., `varchar(100)` vs `varchar(255)`) during validation.
