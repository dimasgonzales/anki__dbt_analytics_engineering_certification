claim_meta:
  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly supports the claim that dbt automatically aliases generic data types like 'string' to adapter-specific types, such as 'text' in Postgres. However, it does not provide evidence for the claim about ignoring precision or size differences, or mention 'float' specifically."
  citation:
    quote: "* **[Type aliasing for model contracts](/reference/resource-configs/contract):** dbt will use each adapter's built-in type aliasing for user-provided data types—meaning you can now write `string` always, and dbt will translate to `text` on Postgres/Redshift."

How does dbt handle generic data types like `string` or `float` in a model contract?

<back>

dbt automatically converts (aliases) generic types to the corresponding data type for your specific data warehouse (e.g., `string` becomes `text` in Postgres). It generally ignores differences in precision or size (e.g., `varchar(100)` vs `varchar(255)`) during validation.
