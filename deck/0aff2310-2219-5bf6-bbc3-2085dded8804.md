  explanation: "The reference text discusses general hierarchical configuration inheritance in dbt, mentioning that configs can be inherited or overridden and that the most specific config takes precedence. However, it does not specifically address source-level or table-level properties, nor does it mention configurations like 'freshness' or 'loaded_at_field'. Thus, there is insufficient information to verify the answer regarding configuration inheritance between source and table levels."

<front>

How does configuration inheritance work between source-level and table-level properties in dbt?

<back>

Configurations defined at the source level (like `freshness` or `loaded_at_field`) apply as defaults to all tables under that source. These settings can be overridden by defining specific values within an individual table's configuration block.
