<front>

A user attempts to troubleshoot a logic error by running `SELECT * FROM my_ephemeral_model` in the warehouse console, but receives a "relation does not exist" error. Why is this happening?

<back>

Ephemeral models do not exist as physical database objects; they are only injected as CTEs into downstream models during compilation. To debug, you must inspect the compiled SQL of a downstream model or temporarily change the materialization to `view` or `table`.
