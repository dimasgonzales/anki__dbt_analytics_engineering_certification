<front>

You are migrating a SQL model to a Python model to utilize a specific data science library. The original SQL model was materialized as a 'view'. You update the code to use `dbt.config(materialized='view')`. What will happen when you run this model?

<back>

dbt will return an error. Python models do not support 'view' materialization because the transformation logic runs in a Python environment (like Snowpark or Databricks), which requires persisting the output as a table structure.
