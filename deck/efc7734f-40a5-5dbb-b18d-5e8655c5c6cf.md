  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that selector methods can be omitted when using --select, which supports the answer's claim that prepending 'path:' is optional. The answer's examples and overall approach align with the documented node selection methods, and no contradictions are found regarding selecting files or directories directly or omitting file extensions."
  citation:
    quote: "While it is recommended to explicitly denote the method, you can omit it (the default value will be one of `path`, `file` or `fqn`)."

<front>

how do you select nodes stored in a particular file/directory?

You can just `--select` the file/directory directly. When specifying a full file path, you can optionally prepend the `path:` method to potentially remove ambiguity, but this is never required. When selecting a specific file, the file extention (.sql) is not required.
  
  
Examples:
  

- `dbt run --select path:models/staging/sales`
- `dbt run --select models/staging/sales`
- `dbt run --select some_model.sql`
- `dbt run --select some_model`

</back>
