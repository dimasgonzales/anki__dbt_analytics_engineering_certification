how do you select nodes stored in a particular file/directory?

You can just `--select` the file/directory directly. When specifying a full file path, you can optionally prepend the `path:` method to potentially remove ambiguity, but this is never required. When selecting a specific file, the file extention (.sql) is not required.
  
  
Examples:
  

- `dbt run --select path:models/staging/sales`
- `dbt run --select models/staging/sales`
- `dbt run --select some_model.sql`
- `dbt run --select some_model`
