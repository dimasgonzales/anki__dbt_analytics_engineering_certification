<front>

You have defined `vars: {region: 'us-east'}` in your `dbt_project.yml`. You try to reference it in a model configuration key within the same file using `+schema: "{{ var('region') }}"`. What will happen when you run dbt?

<back>

The compilation will likely fail or the schema will render literally as the string `"{{ var('region') }}"` rather than `us-east`.

This is because the `vars` defined in the file are not yet available in the parsing context when dbt reads the project configuration. You should use `env_var` or CLI variables instead.
