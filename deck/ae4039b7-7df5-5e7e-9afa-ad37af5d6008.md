<front>

You have a pipeline where `model_A` feeds into `model_B`. You want to ensure `model_B` does not run if the unique test on `model_A` fails. Which command should you use?

</front>

<back>

You should use `dbt build`.

```bash
dbt build --select +model_B
```

Because `dbt build` runs tests immediately after their associated model, a failure in `model_A`'s unique test will cause dbt to skip `model_B` automatically.
