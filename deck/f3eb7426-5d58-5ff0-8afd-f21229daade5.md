  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that 'ignore' is the default value for the on_schema_change configuration and describes that when a new column is added under this default, dbt run does not add it to the target table, matching the answer's claim."
  citation:
    quote: "This is the behavior of `on_schema_change: ignore`, which is set by default. If you add a column to your incremental model, and execute a `dbt run`, this column will *not* appear in your target table."

<front>

What is the default behavior of the `on_schema_change` configuration in dbt incremental models?

<back>

The default behavior is `ignore`. If new columns are added to the SQL logic, dbt continues to run successfully but does not add these new columns to the existing destination table in the warehouse.
