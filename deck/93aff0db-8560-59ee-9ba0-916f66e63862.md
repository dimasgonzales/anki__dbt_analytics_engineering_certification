<front>

You added a file named `audit_churn.sql` to the `analyses/` folder and executed `dbt run`. You check your database schema, but cannot find a table or view named `audit_churn`. Why?

<back>

The `dbt run` command does not process files in the `analyses/` directory. Furthermore, analyses are designed to be compiled into SQL queries but not executed or saved as objects in the data warehouse.
