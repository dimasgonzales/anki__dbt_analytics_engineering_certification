<front>

A model run completes with a "success" status, but downstream stakeholders claim the table is empty. How can you verify this using dbt artifacts?

Inspect the `adapter_response` object within `run_results.json` for that model.

Specifically, look for `rows_affected`. If it is 0, the SQL executed successfully but produced no data.

Example:
```json
"adapter_response": {
  "rows_affected": 0
}
```
