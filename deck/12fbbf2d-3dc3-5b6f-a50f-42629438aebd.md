claim_meta:
  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text shows that 'meta' is a configuration key and a dictionary (e.g., '+meta: {dictionary}'), but it does not explicitly mention that it is reserved for user-defined properties, that it does not affect dbt's native behavior, or that it is accessible to macros, hooks, and external tools. Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the answer."

<front>

What is the purpose of the `meta` configuration key in dbt resources?

<back>

The `meta` config key is a dictionary reserved for user-defined properties. These configurations do not affect dbt's native behavior (like materialization strategy) but are accessible to macros, hooks, and external tools for custom logic.
