  explanation: "The reference text describes how to use the `{{ source() }}` function and its related features such as source freshness and efficient building, but it does not explicitly mention or verify the specific benefits of 'Dependency Management: creating formal DAG edges' and 'Lineage & Selection: enabling accurate lineage generation' as stated in the answer. Therefore, there is not enough information in the provided text to support or contradict the answer."

What are the two primary benefits of using the `{{ source() }}` function over hardcoding table names in dbt models?

1. **Dependency Management:** It creates a formal edge in the DAG connecting the raw source node to the model.
2. **Lineage & Selection:** It enables accurate lineage generation and allows for node selection based on sources (e.g., `dbt run -s source:my_source+`).
