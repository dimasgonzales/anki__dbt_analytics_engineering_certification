What are the two primary benefits of using the `{{ source() }}` function over hardcoding table names in dbt models?

1. **Dependency Management:** It creates a formal edge in the DAG connecting the raw source node to the model.
2. **Lineage & Selection:** It enables accurate lineage generation and allows for node selection based on sources (e.g., `dbt run -s source:my_source+`).
