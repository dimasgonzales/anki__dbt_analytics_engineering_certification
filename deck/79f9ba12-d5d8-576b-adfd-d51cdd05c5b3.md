<front>

You are refactoring a legacy snapshot defined in a `.sql` file to the v1.9+ YAML standard. You have moved the configs to YAML, but the snapshot is failing to compile because it cannot find the source data. What property is likely missing?

<back>

You are likely missing the `relation` property in the YAML definition. Unlike legacy SQL files which implicitly define the logic via a `SELECT * FROM ...`, YAML definitions explicitly require `relation: ref('...')` or `relation: source('...')` to establish the dependency.
