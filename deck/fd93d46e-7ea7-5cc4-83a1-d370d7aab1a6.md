<front>

You are configuring a dbt Cloud Production environment using Terraform. You want to ensure the environment stays stable and does not automatically adopt bleeding-edge features immediately. 

How should you configure the `dbt_version` argument?

You should set the `dbt_version` to `"compatible"`. 

```hcl
resource "dbt_cloud_environment" "prod" {
  dbt_version = "compatible"
  ...
}
```
This ensures the environment remains on a stable release track suitable for production workflows.
