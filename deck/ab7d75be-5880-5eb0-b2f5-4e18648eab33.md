What is the difference between the contents of `target/compiled/` and `target/run/`?

<back>

- `target/compiled/`: Contains the raw `SELECT` statements with all Jinja/Refs resolved. Useful for checking logic.
- `target/run/`: Contains the actual executable DDL/DML (e.g., `CREATE TABLE...` or `INSERT INTO...`) that dbt executes against the warehouse.
