  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly states that dbt environment variables must be prefixed with 'DBT_', which supports the claim that all environment variables in dbt Cloud need to start with 'DBT_'."
  citation:
    quote: "dbt environment variables must be prefixed with `DBT_` (including `DBT_ENV_CUSTOM_ENV_` or `DBT_ENV_SECRET`)."
