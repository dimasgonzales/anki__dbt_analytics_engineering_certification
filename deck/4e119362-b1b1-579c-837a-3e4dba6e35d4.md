<front>

You have a massive fact table model that takes too long to rebuild completely on every run. Which materialization strategy should you use to improve performance?

This strategy allows dbt to insert or update only the records that have changed since the last run, rather than rebuilding the entire table from scratch like the `table` materialization.
