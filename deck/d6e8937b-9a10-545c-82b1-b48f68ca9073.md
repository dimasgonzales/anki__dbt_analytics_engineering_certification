You need to fetch daily currency exchange rates from a public API during your dbt run. Should you write a dbt Python model to handle this?

No. dbt Python models are for **transformation**, not extraction or ingestion. You should not use them to make external network calls (web scraping or API requests). Load the data using an EL tool first, then transform it in dbt.
