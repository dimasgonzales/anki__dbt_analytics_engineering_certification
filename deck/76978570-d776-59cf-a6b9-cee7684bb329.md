Your dbt job runs every hour to capture micro-batches of data, but your BI tool only needs to update once every 24 hours. How would you configure dbt Cloud to support this?

Configure the `DBT_ACTIVE_EXPOSURES_BUILD_AFTER` environment variable to `1440` (minutes). 

```bash
DBT_ACTIVE_EXPOSURES_BUILD_AFTER: 1440
```

This allows the dbt job to run hourly while skipping the exposure refresh step until 24 hours have passed.
