<front>

In a dbt resource file (e.g., `models.yml`), what is the only valid value for the top-level `version` configuration if it is included?

<back>

The only valid supported value is `2`.

While this tag is optional in dbt v1.5+, if it is present, it must be set to `version: 2`. This tells dbt how to parse the structure of the YAML file.
