<front>

Your organization requires all SQL transformation logic to be stored in a folder named `transformations/` rather than `models/`. How do you configure dbt to support this?

<back>

Update the `model-paths` key in your `dbt_project.yml` file.

By default, dbt looks in `models/`, but you can override this to point to any directory structure you prefer.

Example:
```yaml
model-paths: ["transformations"]
```
