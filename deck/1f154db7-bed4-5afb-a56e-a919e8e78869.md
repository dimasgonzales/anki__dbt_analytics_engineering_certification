What are the three access levels available for dbt models and what is the default behavior?

<back>

The three access levels are `public`, `protected`, and `private`. 

- `protected` (Default): Referenceable within the same project or installed packages.
- `public`: Referenceable across different projects.
- `private`: Referenceable only within the same model group.
