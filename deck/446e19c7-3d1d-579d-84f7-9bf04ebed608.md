<front>

A production job failed halfway through execution. You need to retry the pipeline using the artifacts stored in `./previous_run/`, but only for the parts that failed. What command would you execute?

</front>

<back>

You would run:
```bash
dbt build --select result:error+ --state ./previous_run/
```
The `--state` flag points to the directory containing the `manifest.json` and `run_results.json` from the failed run, enabling the `result:error` selector to identify the specific nodes to retry.
