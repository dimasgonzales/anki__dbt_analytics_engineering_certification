  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Answer correctly states to add an entry under the 'exposures' key in a .yml file, specifying type, owner, and 'depends_on' with models listed using ref(). The Reference Text provides an example exposure definition with identical structure and properties, including a dashboard type, owner details, and 'depends_on' listing models with ref(), which directly supports the Answer."

<front>

You need to document that a Tableau dashboard relies on `fct_mrr` and `dim_customers`. How do you represent this in dbt?

<back>

Add an entry to a `.yml` file under the `exposures` key. Specify the type (e.g., `dashboard`), owner details, and list the upstream models in the `depends_on` property:
```yaml
depends_on:
  - ref('fct_mrr')
  - ref('dim_customers')
```
