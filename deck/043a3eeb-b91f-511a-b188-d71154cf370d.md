<front>

You need to document that a Tableau dashboard relies on `fct_mrr` and `dim_customers`. How do you represent this in dbt?

</front>

<back>

Add an entry to a `.yml` file under the `exposures` key. Specify the type (e.g., `dashboard`), owner details, and list the upstream models in the `depends_on` property:
```yaml
depends_on:
  - ref('fct_mrr')
  - ref('dim_customers')
```
