<front>

What are the three key attributes of the `dbtRunnerResult` object returned by a programmatic dbt invocation?

</front>

<back>

1. `success` (bool): Indicates if the command finished without error codes.
2. `result` (object): Contains execution artifacts (like RunResults).
3. `exception` (Exception): Captures unhandled errors (if any).

These map to CLI exit codes 0, 1, and 2.
