<front>

How does the `dbt clone` command handle materialization on data platforms that do not support zero-copy cloning (e.g., Postgres)?

<back>

On platforms without zero-copy support, `dbt clone` creates a **pointer view** in the target schema.

This is effectively a view that selects all records from the source object:
```sql
create view target_schema.my_model as
select * from source_schema.my_model
```

</back>
