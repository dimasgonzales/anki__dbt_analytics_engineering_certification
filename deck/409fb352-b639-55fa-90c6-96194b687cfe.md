<front>

You have modified the SQL logic in `models/marts/fct_orders.sql` locally but have not yet executed `dbt run`. If you execute `dbt show --select fct_orders`, will the output reflect the old table in the warehouse or your new local code?

<back>

It will reflect your **new local code**. `dbt show` compiles the current code in your project files and executes that specific query, ignoring the state or definition of any pre-existing materialization in the database.
