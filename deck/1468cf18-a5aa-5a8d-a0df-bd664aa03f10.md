  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that a User Development Override allows configuring a different dbt version for an individual user account to safely test new features, which directly supports the answer's description of enabling a developer to run dbt commands with a different version without disrupting the team."
  citation:
    quote: "Configure your project to use a different dbt version than what's configured in your development environment. This *override* only affects your user account, no one else's. Use this to safely test new dbt features before upgrading the dbt version for your projects."

What is the purpose of a 'User Development Override' in dbt Cloud?

</front>

<back>

It allows a specific developer to run dbt commands (like `dbt build` or `dbt run`) using a different dbt version than the one configured for the shared project environment. This is primarily used to safely test new versions or upgrades without disrupting the rest of the team.
