<front>

You need to ensure that the role `bi_tool_user` has `select` access to a specific model named `fct_orders`. How would you apply this in the YAML configuration?

<back>

Add a `grants` block under the model's config in your YAML file.

Example:
```yaml
models:
  - name: fct_orders
    config:
      grants:
        select: ['bi_tool_user']
```

</back>
