<front>

Your nightly dbt build is failing because a `table` model processing raw event logs now takes 3 hours to run, causing a timeout. The historical data in this table never changes. How should you resolve this?

<back>

Change the materialization config to `incremental`.

```sql
{{ config(materialized='incremental') }}
```

Since the data is immutable and voluminous, processing only the new rows added since the last run will drastically reduce build time.
