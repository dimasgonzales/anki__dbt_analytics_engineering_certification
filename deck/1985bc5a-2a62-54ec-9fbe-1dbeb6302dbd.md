  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that placing + before a model selects ancestors (upstream parents) and after selects descendants (downstream children), which directly supports the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "Placed after a model/resource — Includes the resource itself and all its descendants (downstream dependencies). Placed before a model/resource — Includes the resource itself and all its ancestors (upstream dependencies)."

In dbt node selection syntax, what is the difference between placing the plus operator (`+`) before a model name versus after it?

<back>

Placing the plus operator before the model name (`+model`) selects the model and all its **upstream parents**. Placing it after the model name (`model+`) selects the model and all its **downstream children**.
