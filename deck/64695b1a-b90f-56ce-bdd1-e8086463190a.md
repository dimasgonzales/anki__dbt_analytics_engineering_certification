How does dbt generate the `dbt_scd_id` for a snapshot record?

<back>

The `dbt_scd_id` is an MD5 hash generated by combining the `unique_key` with the fields used for change detection. For the `timestamp` strategy, it hashes the key and the updated timestamp; for the `check` strategy, it hashes the key and the specified check columns.
