  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text confirms that singular data tests are documented in a YAML file under the data_tests node, placed in the tests directory, and it references the SQL file name, which supports the answer's claim."
  citation:
    quote: "To add a description to a singular data test in your project, add a .yml file to your tests directory, for example, tests/schema.yml with the following content: data_tests: - name: assert_total_payment_amount_is_positive description: > Refunds have a negative amount, so the total amount should always be >= 0."

<front>

You need to document a singular test named `assert_positive_revenue` that validates logic across multiple models. Where does this description go?

<back>

Singular tests are documented under the top-level `data_tests` (or `tests`) node in your `.yml` file, referencing the name of the SQL file containing the test.

```yaml
data_tests:
  - name: assert_positive_revenue
    description: "Ensures revenue is never negative"
```

</back>
