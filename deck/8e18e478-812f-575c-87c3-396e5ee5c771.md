<front>

You need to document a singular test named `assert_positive_revenue` that validates logic across multiple models. Where does this description go?

</front>

<back>

Singular tests are documented under the top-level `data_tests` (or `tests`) node in your `.yml` file, referencing the name of the SQL file containing the test.

```yaml
data_tests:
  - name: assert_positive_revenue
    description: "Ensures revenue is never negative"
```

</back>
