  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that the DBT_MACRO_DEBUGGING environment variable must be set to use the debug() macro, which directly supports the answer."

<front>

Which environment variable is required to activate the `{{ debug() }}` macro during a dbt run?

</front>

---

<back>

The `DBT_MACRO_DEBUGGING` environment variable.

Without setting this variable (e.g., to `1` or `write`), dbt will ignore the `{{ debug() }}` macro and execution will proceed without pausing.
