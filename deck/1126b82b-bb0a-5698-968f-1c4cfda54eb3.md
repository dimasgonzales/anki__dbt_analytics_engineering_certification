  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer correctly identifies removing an existing column, changing a column's data_type, and removing a constraint as breaking changes, and states that adding a column is non-breaking. This is explicitly supported by the reference text: breaking changes are listed in versioning/rank_1.md, and adding a column as non-breaking is confirmed in versioning/rank_3.md."

In the context of dbt model contracts, what specific schema modifications are classified as "breaking changes"?

<back>

Breaking changes include removing an existing column, changing a column's `data_type`, or removing a constraint. These actions break the API guarantee provided to downstream consumers. Adding a new column is considered non-breaking.
