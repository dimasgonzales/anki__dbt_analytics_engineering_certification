  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that ref, source, and config are context properties and not dispatched as global macros, which directly supports the answer's claim that they cannot be overridden via standard package dispatch."
  citation:
    quote: "Note that the `ref`, `source`, and `config` functions can't be overridden with a package. This is because `ref`, `source`, and `config` are context properties within dbt and are not dispatched as global macros."

<front>

Why can't core context methods like `ref` and `source` be overridden via standard package dispatch (adapter dispatch)?

<back>

`ref`, `source`, and `config` are **context properties** bound directly to the compilation context. They are not dispatched global macros, so they do not follow the standard adapter lookup order used by packages like `dbt_utils`.
