Why can't core context methods like `ref` and `source` be overridden via standard package dispatch (adapter dispatch)?

`ref`, `source`, and `config` are **context properties** bound directly to the compilation context. They are not dispatched global macros, so they do not follow the standard adapter lookup order used by packages like `dbt_utils`.
