  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer is supported by the reference text. The default behavior of dbt inferring data types from CSV data is explicitly confirmed. The method to override using the column_types configuration is also mentioned, with the '+column_types' in the answer being a notation variation that aligns with the referenced configuration."

<front>

How does dbt determine column data types for seeds by default, and how can you override this?

<back>

By default, dbt infers datatypes by scanning the CSV data. To override this inference (e.g., to preserve leading zeros), you must explicitly define types using the `+column_types` configuration.
