It mentions 'run results' and 'sources.json' but does not refer to 'manifest.json' or 'catalog.json', and does not explicitly list or confirm the three artifacts as stated."

Which three primary JSON artifacts does dbt generate to track the state of the project, execution timing, and database metadata?

<back>

1. `manifest.json`: Represents the complete project graph and configuration.
2. `run-results.json`: Captures the success/failure and timing of the most recent execution.
3. `catalog.json`: Stores metadata (columns, types) queried from the data warehouse for documentation.
