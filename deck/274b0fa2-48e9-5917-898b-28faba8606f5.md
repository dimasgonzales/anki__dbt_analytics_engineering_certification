  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text from modularity/index.md explicitly supports the definitions: staging models are identified from import CTEs and handle transformations within individual sources without joins, matching the flashcard's 1:1 relationship and light transformations; intermediate models are for complex or reusable components, aligning with handling complex logic and aggregations."
  citation:
    quote: "To identify our staging models, we want to look at the things we've imported in our import CTEs... transformations that can occur within each of these sources without needing to be joined to each other. when a model becomes complex or can be divided out into reusable components you may consider an intermediate model."

<front>

In a modular dbt architecture, what is the specific purpose of Staging models versus Intermediate models?

<back>

start
* **Staging Models**: Have a 1:1 relationship with sources; used only for cleaning and renaming (light transformations).
* **Intermediate Models**: Handle complex logic, joins, and aggregations; usually materialized as ephemeral or view and referenced by final marts.
