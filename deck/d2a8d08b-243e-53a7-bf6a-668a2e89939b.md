  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text mentions a limitation with relative paths in `packages.yml` and a workaround using Studio IDE, but does not explicitly state that dbt Cloud CLI does not support local file paths or the `local:` key, nor does it compare this restriction to dbt Core. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to verify the specific claim in the answer."

<front>

What restriction does the dbt Cloud CLI enforce regarding package imports in `packages.yml` compared to dbt Core?

<back>

The dbt Cloud CLI does **not** support local file paths (relative paths) for packages. You cannot use the `local:` key to import code from a sibling directory on your machine; you must use Git or Registry based imports.
