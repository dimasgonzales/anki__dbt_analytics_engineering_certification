  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer correctly states that setting the 'access' property to 'public' enables models to be referenced by external projects, as the text defines 'public' access as referenceable by any group, package, or project. Additionally, it confirms that by default, models are 'protected,' which restricts references to the same project or package, aligning with the answer's claim about default behavior."

How do you configure a dbt model to allow it to be referenced by external projects in a dbt Mesh or multi-project architecture?

You must explicitly set the `access` property to `public` in the model's configuration. By default, models are considered `protected` (internal to the project) and cannot be referenced by other projects.
