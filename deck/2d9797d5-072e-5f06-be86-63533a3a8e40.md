  explanation: "The reference text confirms that only public models can be referenced by external projects in dbt Mesh, as it states 'allows for the resolution of references to only the public models in a project.' However, it does not explicitly mention the `access` property, how to set it to `public`, or that models are `protected` by default. Therefore, the specific configuration details in the answer are not found in the provided text."

<front>

How do you configure a dbt model to allow it to be referenced by external projects in a dbt Mesh or multi-project architecture?

You must explicitly set the `access` property to `public` in the model's configuration. By default, models are considered `protected` (internal to the project) and cannot be referenced by other projects.
