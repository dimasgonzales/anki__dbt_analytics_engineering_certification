<front>

What are the four specific sections of the standardized CTE structure used for dbt model modularity?

</front>

<back>

1. **Import CTEs:** Select from sources/refs.
2. **Logical CTEs:** Perform transformations.
3. **Final CTE:** Join previous CTEs.
4. **Simple Select:** Select everything from the Final CTE.

This structure separates data loading from transformation logic.
