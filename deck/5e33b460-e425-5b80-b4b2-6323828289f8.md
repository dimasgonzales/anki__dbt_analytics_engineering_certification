You want to quickly preview the result of joining two models using Jinja without creating a permanent model file, and you need to see 20 rows. What command would you run?

Use `dbt show --inline` with the SQL string and the `--limit` flag.

```bash
dbt show --inline "select * from {{ ref('model_a') }} join {{ ref('model_b') }} using (id)" --limit 20
```

</back>
