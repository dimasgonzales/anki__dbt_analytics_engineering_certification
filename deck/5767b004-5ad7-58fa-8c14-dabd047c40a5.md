<front>

A developer runs `dbt run` and notices their models are being built in the `public` schema instead of their personal development schema. What is the most likely configuration issue?

<back>

The developer's `profiles.yml` is likely misconfigured. Specifically, the `schema` key under the active `target` (e.g., `dev`) is probably set to `public` or missing, rather than being set to a unique identifier like `dbt_username`.

```yaml
dev:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: snowflake
      schema: dbt_jdoe # Check this value
```
