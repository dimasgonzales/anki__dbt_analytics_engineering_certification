<front>

To update metric definitions in the `semantic_manifest.json` without necessarily rebuilding all underlying data models, which lightweight dbt command is sufficient?

<back>

The `dbt parse` command. 

This command parses the project and updates the `semantic_manifest.json` artifact required by the Semantic Layer. Note: If using the dbt Fusion engine, `dbt docs generate` is required instead.
