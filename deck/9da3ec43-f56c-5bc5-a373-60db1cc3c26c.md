What is the default quoting behavior for the Snowflake adapter in dbt, and why is it different from adapters like Postgres?

</front>

<back>

Snowflake defaults to **unquoted** (`false`) identifiers.

This is because Snowflake stores unquoted identifiers in uppercase by default. If dbt quoted them (e.g., `"table"`), they would become case-sensitive and fail to match the default uppercase storage (`TABLE`) unless the casing matched exactly.
