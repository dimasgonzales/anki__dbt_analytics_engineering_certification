<front>

You need to ensure an error is raised if the `orders` source table hasn't received new data in the last 24 hours. How would you configure this in the source YAML?

<back>

Define the `loaded_at_field` pointing to the relevant timestamp, and set the `error_after` threshold to 24 hours inside the `freshness` block.
```yaml
tables:
  - name: orders
    config:
      loaded_at_field: created_at
      freshness:
        error_after: {count: 24, period: hour}
```

</back>
