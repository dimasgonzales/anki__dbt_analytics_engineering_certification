  explanation: "The reference text defines singular tests as SQL queries that return failing records, supporting the description of what a singular test is and its passing/failing condition, but it does not provide information on their location in the `tests` folder or that they are not defined in YAML. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to fully verify the answer."
