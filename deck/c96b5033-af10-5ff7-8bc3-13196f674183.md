<front>

You are pivoting data and need to create a column alias for every payment method in a list. How do you inject the current loop variable into the SQL string alias?

Context:
`{% for method in methods %}`

</front>

<back>

You use the Expression syntax `{{ ... }}` around the loop variable.

Example:
```sql
... as {{ method }}_amount
```
This outputs the value of `method` (e.g., 'cash') into the compiled SQL string (e.g., `cash_amount`).

</back>
