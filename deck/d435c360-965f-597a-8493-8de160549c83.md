<front>

You created a macro to log a message only if a specific model is running. However, the log never triggers, even when the model is selected. Given the code below, what is the issue?

```jinja
{% if 'model.proj.users' in selected_resources %}
  {{ log('Running users', info=True) }}
{% endif %}
```

</front>

<back>

The code is evaluated during parsing when `selected_resources` is empty, causing the condition to fail before execution begins. To fix this, you must wrap the condition in `{% if execute %}`:

```jinja
{% if execute %}
  {% if 'model.proj.users' in selected_resources %}
     ...
  {% endif %}
{% endif %}
```

</back>
