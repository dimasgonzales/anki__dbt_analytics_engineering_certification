  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The Reference Text lists 'run_query' as a Jinja function in the dbt documentation, but it does not contain explicit information on how to use it to execute SQL queries, its transaction behavior, or its comparison with statement blocks. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to fully verify the Answer."

<front>

How can you execute a SQL query against your data warehouse using Jinja?

</front>

<back>

`run_query('query string')`. Note that `run_query` doesn't begin a transaction automatically; if you want transaction behavior, the query string needs to explicitly contain the relevant begin/commit/rollback commands for your database.  
  
`run_query` is a nice wrapper around the more flexible (but more complicated/clunkier) `statement` block
