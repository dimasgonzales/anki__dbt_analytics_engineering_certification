<front>

You are setting up a CI/CD step to validate project syntax errors (YAML/Jinja) but do not want to expose warehouse credentials to this specific pipeline step. Which command should you use?

<back>

You should use `dbt parse`. 

Since this command validates syntax and builds the project graph without establishing a connection to the data warehouse, it is safe to run in environments without database credentials.
