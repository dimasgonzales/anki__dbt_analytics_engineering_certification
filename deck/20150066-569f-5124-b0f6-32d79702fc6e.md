<front>

You imported the `dbt_utils` package but do not want to run any of the tests included within that package by default. How would you configure this in `dbt_project.yml`?

<back>

Target the package name under the `data_tests` block and set `+enabled: false`.

```yaml
data_tests:
  dbt_utils:
    +enabled: false
```

This disables all tests originating from the `dbt_utils` package without modifying the package code directly.
