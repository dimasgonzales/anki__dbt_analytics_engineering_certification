What syntax is used within the dbt Docs Lineage view to filter the visible graph nodes?

<back>

The dbt Docs Lineage filter accepts the standard **Node Selection Syntax** used in the CLI.

This means you can use graph operators (like `+`), set intersections, and method selectors (like `tag:` or `source:`) directly in the UI search bar.
