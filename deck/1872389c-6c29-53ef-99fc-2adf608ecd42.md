  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text confirms that cross-project references default to resolving to the upstream project's Production environment. It explains that they only resolve to Staging if a Staging deployment is present, which aligns with the answer stating that Production is the default and alternatives like Staging must be explicitly enabled."

    quote: "If `Project B` also has a Staging deployment, then references to unbuilt upstream models within `Project B` will resolve to that environment, using [deferral](/docs/cloud/about-cloud-develop-defer), rather than resolving to the models in Production."

<front>

When running dbt in a Development environment, which environment of an upstream project does a cross-project `ref()` resolve to by default?

<back>

By default, it resolves to the upstream project's **Production** environment. This ensures developers build against the reliable source of truth unless an alternative resolution strategy (like Staging) is explicitly enabled.
