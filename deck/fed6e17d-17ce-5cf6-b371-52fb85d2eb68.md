<front>

What does the `on_table_exists` configuration control in dbt?

</front>

---

<back>

It determines how dbt handles replacing existing tables during a run. The default is usually `rename` (create temp table, swap names, drop old) to ensure atomicity, but it can be set to `drop` or `replace` for platforms that do not support atomic renaming.
