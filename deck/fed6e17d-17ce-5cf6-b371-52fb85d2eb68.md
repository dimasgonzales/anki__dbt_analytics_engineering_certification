  explanation: "The reference text contains code snippets showing `on_table_exists` used with values like 'rename', 'drop', 'append', 'delete+insert', and 'merge', but it does not explicitly describe what the configuration controls, its default values, or handling methods such as atomicity and platform-specific options as stated in the answer. No direct evidence supports or contradicts the answer's details."

<front>

What does the `on_table_exists` configuration control in dbt?

</front>

---

<back>

It determines how dbt handles replacing existing tables during a run. The default is usually `rename` (create temp table, swap names, drop old) to ensure atomicity, but it can be set to `drop` or `replace` for platforms that do not support atomic renaming.
