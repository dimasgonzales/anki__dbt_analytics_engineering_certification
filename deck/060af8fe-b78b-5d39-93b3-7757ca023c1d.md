<front>

A specific model contains known data quality issues that act as "technical debt." You want to ensure `dbt build` completes successfully even if the tests on this model fail, but you still want the failures logged in the console. What configuration should you apply?

</front>

<back>

Set the test severity to `warn`. This prevents the failure from blocking downstream models or failing the pipeline run.

```yaml
tests:
  - unique:
      column_name: id
      config:
        severity: warn
```

</back>
