<front>

You are trying to document a model column using a bulleted list in `schema.yml`. However, in the generated documentation site, the list renders as a single paragraph of text. What is causing this?

<back>

You likely used the **folded** operator (`>`) or a standard string, which collapses newlines.

To fix this, use the **literal** operator (`|`) to preserve the newlines required for Markdown lists to render correctly:
```yaml
description: |
  - Point A
  - Point B
```
