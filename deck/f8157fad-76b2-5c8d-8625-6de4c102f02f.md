What logic does dbt apply when multiple arguments are passed to the `--select` flag separated by spaces?

</front>

<back>

dbt applies **Union (OR)** logic. This means a resource is selected if it matches *at least one* of the provided arguments. It effectively combines all distinct sets into one execution list.

Example:
```bash
dbt run --select model_a model_b
# Runs model_a OR model_b
```
