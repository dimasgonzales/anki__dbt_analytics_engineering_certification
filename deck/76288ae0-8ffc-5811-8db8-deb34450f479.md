<front>

You installed a dbt package named `snowplow` that includes a source named `events` with a table `page_views`. You need to disable this specific table in your project. How do you configure this in `dbt_project.yml`?

Define the configuration using the package name as the top level under sources:

```yaml
sources:
  snowplow:        # package_name
    events:        # source_name
      page_views:  # table_name
        +enabled: false
```
