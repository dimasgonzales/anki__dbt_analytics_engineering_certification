<front>

You recently renamed `dbt_valid_to` to `valid_until` in your project config. Your snapshot job is now failing with a "column not found" error. How do you resolve this?

You must align the database schema with the new configuration. You can either manually rename the column in the database using DDL or drop the table and rebuild it (losing history) using the full-refresh flag.

```bash
dbt snapshot --full-refresh
```
