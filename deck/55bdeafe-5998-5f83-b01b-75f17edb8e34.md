  explanation: "The Reference Text mentions 'executionTime' and 'runElapsedTime' as execution details used for monitoring model performance but does not provide definitions or differentiate between them. Therefore, the specific claims in the answer regarding what each metric measures cannot be verified."

What is the difference between `executionTime` and `runElapsedTime` when analyzing dbt job metadata?

<back>

`executionTime` measures the time spent specifically building the model or running the test in the data warehouse. `runElapsedTime` is the total wall-clock time, which includes job overhead, queuing, and waiting for available threads.
