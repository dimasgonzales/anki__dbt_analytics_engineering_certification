<front>

dbt Explorer flags a health warning: 'Model `stg_payments` is missing a unique test on its primary key.' How do you resolve this?

</front>

<back>

Update the `schema.yml` (or properties file) for the model to include the `unique` test on the primary key column.

```yaml
models:
  - name: stg_payments
    columns:
      - name: payment_id
        tests:
          - unique
```

</back>
