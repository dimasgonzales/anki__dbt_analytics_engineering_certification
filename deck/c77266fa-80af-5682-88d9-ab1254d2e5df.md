  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that project-level dependencies in dependencies.yml are displayed in the Project Lineage graph even without ref() statements, directly supporting the answer."

<front>

You have added an upstream project to `dependencies.yml` but have not yet written any `{{ ref() }}` statements selecting models from that project. Will the Project Lineage graph show a connection?

Yes. The Project Lineage graph reflects the configuration in `dependencies.yml`. The project-level dependency edge is created as soon as the project is defined in the YAML file, regardless of model-level references.
