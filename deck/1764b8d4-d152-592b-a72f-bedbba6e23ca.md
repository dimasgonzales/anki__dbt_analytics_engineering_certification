You are setting up a scheduled nightly job in dbt Cloud. Why should you use a 'Deployment' environment rather than reusing a 'Development' environment?

A **Deployment** environment is specifically designed for stable production execution, whereas a Development environment is tied to individual user sessions. Deployment environments ensure the job runs on a consistent schedule, often using a dedicated service account credential rather than a specific developer's credentials.
