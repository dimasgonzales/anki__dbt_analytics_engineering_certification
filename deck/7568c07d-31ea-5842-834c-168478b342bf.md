  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that the Latest status lens tags models reused from state-aware orchestration with 'Reused', which directly matches the answer's claim about identifying optimized models."
  citation:
    quote: "When you use this lens to view your lineage, models that were reused from state-aware orchestration are tagged with **Reused**."
