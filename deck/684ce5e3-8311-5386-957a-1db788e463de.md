<front>

You need to version control a complex SQL query for a one-off quarterly audit that depends on existing dbt models. You do not want to create a permanent view in the database. How should you structure this in dbt?

Save the SQL file in the `analyses/` directory and use `{{ ref() }}` to select from your models. This allows you to keep the query under version control and handle schema changes automatically without materializing a new database object.
