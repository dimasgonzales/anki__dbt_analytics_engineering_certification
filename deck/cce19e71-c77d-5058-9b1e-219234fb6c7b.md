<front>

You have defined `+access: private` for your `marts` folder in `dbt_project.yml`, but you have one specific model, `fct_orders`, that needs to be referenced by a separate project. How do you handle this exception?

<back>

You should configure `access: public` specifically for `fct_orders` within its individual config block or property file. 

Model-specific configurations take precedence over directory-level defaults set in `dbt_project.yml`, effectively overriding the private restriction for that single model.
