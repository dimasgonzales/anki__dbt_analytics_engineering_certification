  explanation: "The Reference Text only provides evidence for triggering jobs on a schedule, but does not mention or support the other three methods (webhooks, dbt Cloud API, or manual triggering via UI) listed in the Answer. Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the entire answer."

    quote: "A dbt production job allows you to set up a system to run a dbt job and job commands on a schedule, rather than running dbt commands manually from the command line or [Studio IDE]."
