  explanation: "The answer lists four ways to trigger jobs: on a schedule (e.g., cron), via webhooks, via the dbt Cloud API, and manually via the UI. The reference text confirms scheduling (including cron), API triggering, and manual triggering. However, while webhooks are mentioned in the context of CI jobs (e.g., PR commits), the provided text does not explicitly state that webhooks are a general method to trigger all job types in dbt Cloud. Therefore, the presence of 'webhooks' as a universal trigger method is not fully supported by the evidence."

    quote: "Trigger jobs can be scheduled using dbt Cloud's job scheduler. The scheduler enables both cron-based and event-driven execution of dbt commands in the user's data platform. Trigger jobs can be triggered by API calls or manual actions."
