<front>

You are reviewing a PR where a model performing complex joins before the final table is named `sales_pre_calculation`. How should this be renamed to follow dbt conventions for an intermediate model?

It should be renamed to start with the prefix `int_`, such as `int_sales_pre_calculation`. Ideally, it should also be placed in a `/models/intermediate/` directory.
