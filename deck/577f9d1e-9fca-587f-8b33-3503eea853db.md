  explanation: "The reference text discusses dbt best practices, including breaking complex models into smaller pieces and using intermediate transformations, but it does not mention specific naming conventions like prefixing with 'int_' or placing models in a '/models/intermediate/' directory. Therefore, the answer cannot be verified based on the provided evidence."

<front>

You are reviewing a PR where a model performing complex joins before the final table is named `sales_pre_calculation`. How should this be renamed to follow dbt conventions for an intermediate model?

<back>

It should be renamed to start with the prefix `int_`, such as `int_sales_pre_calculation`. Ideally, it should also be placed in a `/models/intermediate/` directory.
