<front>

What are the two primary triggers for changing a model's materialization from `table` to `incremental`?

You should switch to `incremental` when:
1. Source data volume becomes too large (millions/billions of rows).
2. Transformations are computationally expensive (e.g., Regex, UDFs).

This switch is necessary when standard table rebuilds exceed time or cost budgets.
