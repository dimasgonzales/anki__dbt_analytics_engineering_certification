  explanation: "The reference text mentions 'Empty mode' in the context of tests, describing it as ignoring indirect dependencies and not executing tests. However, it does not specify that it forces `ref()` and `source()` queries to return zero rows or serves as a dry run for SQL syntax validation without data processing. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to support or contradict the answer."

It doesn't execute any tests, whether they are directly attached to the selected node or not. The empty mode does not include any tests and is automatically used for [interactive compilation](/reference/commands/compile#int"

What is the primary purpose of the `--empty` flag in dbt commands?

<back>

It performs a 'dry run' of the project where all `ref()` and `source()` queries are forced to return zero rows.

This validates SQL syntax and the existence of dependencies without incurring the cost of processing actual data.
