  explanation: "The definition of partial parsing is supported by the reference text, but there is no evidence for the CLI flag '--no-partial-parse' or any method to disable partial parsing via CLI flags in the provided text. The reference only mentions partial parsing in the context of the Studio IDE and discusses other CLI flags unrelated to partial parsing."

What is "partial parsing" in dbt, and what CLI flag is used to disable it?

</front>

<back>

Partial parsing is a performance feature where dbt analyzes only files that have changed since the last run. To disable it and force dbt to process every file in the project, use the `--no-partial-parse` flag.

Example:
```bash
dbt parse --no-partial-parse
```
