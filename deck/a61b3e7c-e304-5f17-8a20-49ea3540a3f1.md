<front>

What is "partial parsing" in dbt, and what CLI flag is used to disable it?

</front>

<back>

Partial parsing is a performance feature where dbt analyzes only files that have changed since the last run. To disable it and force dbt to process every file in the project, use the `--no-partial-parse` flag.

Example:
```bash
dbt parse --no-partial-parse
```
