What is a dbt **exposure** and how is it configured?

<back>

An exposure is a resource that defines a downstream consumer of your dbt project, such as a dashboard, ML model, or reverse ETL sync. It is configured in a `.yml` file using the `exposures:` key.

Example config:
```yaml
exposures:
  - name: weekly_revenue_dashboard
    type: dashboard
    depends_on:
      - ref('fct_revenue')
```

</back>
