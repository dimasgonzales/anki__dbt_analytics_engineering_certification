  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly supports that defer does not create new database objects and restricts their use to the dbt context, while clone creates objects in the target schema that are accessible by downstream tools, aligning with the Answer."

<front>

What is the primary difference between `defer` and `clone` regarding object existence in the target schema?

<back>

**Defer** does *not* create upstream objects in the target schema; it purely resolves references to the production schema during the dbt run.

**Clone** physically creates objects (metadata copies or views) in the target schema, making them accessible to users and tools outside of the current dbt process.
