<front>

What is the primary difference between `defer` and `clone` regarding object existence in the target schema?

<back>

**Defer** does *not* create upstream objects in the target schema; it purely resolves references to the production schema during the dbt run.

**Clone** physically creates objects (metadata copies or views) in the target schema, making them accessible to users and tools outside of the current dbt process.
