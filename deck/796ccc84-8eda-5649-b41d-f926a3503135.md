  explanation: "The Answer refers to 'dbt Cloud Metadata API' and includes a specific GraphQL query with a 'lineage' object. However, the Reference Text consistently uses the term 'Discovery API' for the interface that allows programmatic querying of metadata via GraphQL, and the provided examples, such as using 'ancestors' in queries, do not match the exact 'lineage' object or the API name mentioned in the Answer. While the concept of querying lineage metadata is supported, the specific terminology and query structure are not explicitly confirmed in the text."

What interface does dbt Cloud provide to programmatically query the DAG and lineage metadata?

<back>

The **dbt Cloud Metadata API** (using GraphQL). 

It allows you to query the `lineage` object to retrieve information about models, sources, tests, and their relationships without relying on the visual dbt Docs interface.

Example:
```graphql
query {
  environment(id: 123) {
    applied {
      lineage(filter: {"types": ["Model"]}) { ... }
    }
  }
}
```
