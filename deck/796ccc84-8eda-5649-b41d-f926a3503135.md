What interface does dbt Cloud provide to programmatically query the DAG and lineage metadata?

<back>

The **dbt Cloud Metadata API** (using GraphQL). 

It allows you to query the `lineage` object to retrieve information about models, sources, tests, and their relationships without relying on the visual dbt Docs interface.

Example:
```graphql
query {
  environment(id: 123) {
    applied {
      lineage(filter: {"types": ["Model"]}) { ... }
    }
  }
}
```
