  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer correctly states that dbt clean deletes paths specified in the clean-targets list, which is explicitly supported by the reference text. The additional claim about dbt deps cleaning automatically in dbt Cloud is not mentioned in the provided evidence, but it does not contradict the core fact about dbt clean."
  citation:

<front>

What does the `dbt clean` command do?

</front>

<back>

It deletes all folders specified in the `clean-targets` list specified in dbt\_project.yml.  
  
In dbt Cloud, the `dbt deps` command cleans before it installs packages automatically, without the need for this command to be run first.
