<front>

You need to grant usage permissions on a target schema to a reporting role immediately after a `dbt run` completes. How would you automate this in dbt?

<back>

Add a SQL `GRANT` statement to the `on-run-end` hook in `dbt_project.yml`.

```yaml
on-run-end:
  - "GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA {{ target.schema }} TO ROLE reporting"
```

</back>
