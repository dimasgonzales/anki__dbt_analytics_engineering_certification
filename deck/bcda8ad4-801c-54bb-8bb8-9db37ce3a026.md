Broadly, what three things do you specify for each environment?

</front>

<back>

1. dbt version ("what version of dbt should I use?")
2. git branch ("what branch should I pull from?")
3. data location ("where do I want to build the data?")

The main differences between the development environment and development environments

- There is only **one** development environment per project, standardized for all developers on the project.
- In **deployment** environments, all three attributes above are environment-level settings. In the **development** environment, the dbt version is an env. setting but the branch is chosen through the UI by each developer and the data location is determined by each developer's profile settings (so each developer has a separate dev schema they can work in without affecting others)
