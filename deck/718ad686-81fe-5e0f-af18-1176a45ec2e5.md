What is the difference in failure behavior between enabling the 'Generate docs on run' checkbox and adding 'dbt docs generate' as a command step in a dbt Cloud Job?

The checkbox is **non-blocking**, meaning the job will still succeed even if documentation generation fails. Adding `dbt docs generate` as a command step is **blocking**; if it fails, the entire job fails and subsequent steps are skipped.
