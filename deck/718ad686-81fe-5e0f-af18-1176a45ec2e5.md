  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly supports the Answer: enabling the 'Generate docs on run' checkbox is non-blocking, as the job can succeed even if that step fails, while adding 'dbt docs generate' as a command step is blocking, as the job fails if that step fails."

What is the difference in failure behavior between enabling the 'Generate docs on run' checkbox and adding 'dbt docs generate' as a command step in a dbt Cloud Job?

The checkbox is **non-blocking**, meaning the job will still succeed even if documentation generation fails. Adding `dbt docs generate` as a command step is **blocking**; if it fails, the entire job fails and subsequent steps are skipped.
