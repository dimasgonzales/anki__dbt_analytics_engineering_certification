  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that seeds can only be configured from YAML files, confirming the answer's claim that configurations for seeds must be applied via dbt_project.yml or property .yml files, rather than using the {{ config() }} macro inside seed files."

<front>

Why can't you use the `{{ config() }}` macro inside a dbt seed file to set its configuration?

<back>

Seeds are static `.csv` files, not `.sql` or `.py` files. They do not support Jinja parsing inside the file itself. Therefore, all configurations for seeds (like schema, quoting, or enabled status) must be applied via `dbt_project.yml` or a property `.yml` file.
