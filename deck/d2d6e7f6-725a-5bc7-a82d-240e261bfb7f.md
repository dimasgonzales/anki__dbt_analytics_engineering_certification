Why can't you use the `{{ config() }}` macro inside a dbt seed file to set its configuration?

<back>

Seeds are static `.csv` files, not `.sql` or `.py` files. They do not support Jinja parsing inside the file itself. Therefore, all configurations for seeds (like schema, quoting, or enabled status) must be applied via `dbt_project.yml` or a property `.yml` file.
