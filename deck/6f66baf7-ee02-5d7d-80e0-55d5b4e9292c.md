  explanation: "The reference text discusses dbt versioning and running models with multiple versions using flags like --select, but it does not mention or provide information about unit tests for versioned models. Therefore, the answer about default behavior for unit tests cannot be verified with the given text."

No specific configuration is required to enable this multi-version testing behavior.
