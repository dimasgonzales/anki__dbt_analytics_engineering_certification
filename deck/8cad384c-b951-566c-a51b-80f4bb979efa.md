<front>

An incremental model configured with `on_schema_change='fail'` passes in CI but fails immediately in Production after adding a new column. What is the likely cause?

<back>

The CI pipeline likely performed a **full refresh** (creating the table from scratch) because the table didn't exist in the temporary CI schema. 

Since full refreshes recreate the table, they do not trigger schema drift errors. In Production, the table existed, so dbt attempted an incremental run and correctly failed due to the column mismatch.
