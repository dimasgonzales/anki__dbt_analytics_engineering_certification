<front>

You want to test the `stg_payments` model using `dbt test --select stg_payments`. However, this model has a data test that references an unbuilt upstream model, causing an error. Which flag resolves this by skipping tests missing selected parents?

<back>

You should use `--indirect-selection=cautious`. 

Command:
```bash
dbt test --select stg_payments --indirect-selection=cautious
```
This ensures tests run only if *all* their referenced parents are included in the selection.
