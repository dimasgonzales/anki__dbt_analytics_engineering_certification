<front>

You are using the dbt Cloud CLI and notice a delay before your run starts while it fetches state data. If you do not need the latest manifest for state comparison for a specific run, how can you speed up the execution?

You can use the `--download-artifacts=false` flag. This tells the CLI to skip downloading the production artifacts from dbt Cloud, effectively speeding up the run initiation.

```bash
dbt run --select my_model --download-artifacts=false
```
