  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text provides evidence for Compilation Errors occurring during parsing, as shown with examples like invalid ref functions, but it does not explicitly mention or define 'Database Errors' as occurring after parsing during SQL execution with causes such as permission denied or SQL syntax error. The text refers to 'Runtime Errors' with examples focused on project setup issues, not SQL execution errors, leaving the Database Errors part of the answer unverified."

<front>

In dbt, what is the primary difference between a 'Compilation Error' and a 'Database Error'?

<back>

**Compilation Errors** occur during parsing (before SQL execution) due to invalid Jinja, YAML syntax, or broken refs. **Database Errors** occur after parsing when the warehouse attempts to execute the SQL (e.g., permission denied, SQL syntax error).
