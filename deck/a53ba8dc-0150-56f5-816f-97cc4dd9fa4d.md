<front>

You are debugging a single model that joins 6 raw tables and performs complex window functions, making the root cause of a data discrepancy hard to find. How should you refactor this?

<back>

Split the complex model into several **intermediate models**. By modularizing the logic (e.g., performing cleanups or specific joins in separate files), you create 'Intermediate Representations' that can be tested individually, making it easier to pinpoint where the data discrepancy originates.
