  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer accurately captures the recommended performance-based hierarchy from the reference text, which advises starting with a view for simplicity, moving to a table when query latency is too slow, and then to incremental when build time is too slow."

What is the recommended hierarchy/order of operations when selecting a materialization strategy based on performance?

1. Start with `view` (easiest, lowest storage).
2. Change to `table` if query latency becomes too slow for end-users.
3. Change to `incremental` if the table build time becomes too slow during dbt runs.
