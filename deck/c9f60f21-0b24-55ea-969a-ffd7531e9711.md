What is the recommended hierarchy/order of operations when selecting a materialization strategy based on performance?

1. Start with `view` (easiest, lowest storage).
2. Change to `table` if query latency becomes too slow for end-users.
3. Change to `incremental` if the table build time becomes too slow during dbt runs.
