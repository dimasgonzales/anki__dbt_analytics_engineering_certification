<front>

A downstream stakeholder complains they were not notified about a breaking change to `dim_customers` that broke their Looker dashboard. How should you configure your project to prevent this in the future?

</front>

<back>

Create an **exposure** for the Looker dashboard in your dbt project. Define the `owner` (stakeholder's email) and add `dim_customers` to the `depends_on` list. This documents the dependency and ownership directly in the DAG, making impact analysis visible during development.
