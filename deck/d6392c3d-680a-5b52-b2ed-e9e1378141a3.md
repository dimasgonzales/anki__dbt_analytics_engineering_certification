Your organization uses AWS S3 for storage. You need to make the dbt project documentation available to stakeholders. Do you need to provision an EC2 server to host the docs?

No. Because dbt Docs generates a **static website**, you do not need an active application server like EC2. You can simply configure the S3 bucket for static website hosting and upload the contents of the `target/` directory (specifically `index.html`, `manifest.json`, and `catalog.json`).
