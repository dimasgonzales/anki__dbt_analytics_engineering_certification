What **dbt\_project.yml** field is used to specify a custom comment to be injected into each query that dbt runs against your database? What is the default?

**query-comment**. By default, dbt prepends a JSON comment string to the top of each query with some useful metadata:  
```
/\* {"app": "dbt", "dbt\_version": "0.15.0rc2", "profile\_name": "debug",
"target\_name": "dev", "node\_id": "model.dbt2.my\_model"} \*/
create view analytics.analytics.orders as (
select ...
);
```This option allows users to override this default comment. The comment can be passed as a string (optionally using Jinja variables), or as a macro call that returns a string. There is also an expanded "dictionary syntax":  
```
query-comment:
comment: string
append: true | false
job-label: true | false # BigQuery only
```The "append" flag determines whether the comment is *pre*pended (default) or *ap*pended to the query.  
  
Including the field, but leaving it blank or null will effectively disable query comments.
