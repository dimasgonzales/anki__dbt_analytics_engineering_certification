<front>

You are migrating a stored procedure that executes the following command: `DELETE FROM orders WHERE status = 'test'`. How do you implement this logic in a dbt model?

<back>

Instead of deleting records, you simply exclude them from your `SELECT` statement using a `WHERE` clause.

Example:
```sql
select * 
from {{ source('raw', 'orders') }}
where status != 'test'
```

</back>
