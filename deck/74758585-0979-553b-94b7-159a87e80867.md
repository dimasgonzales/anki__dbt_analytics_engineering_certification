In dbt YAML configuration, what is the difference between the `>` (folded) and `|` (literal) block scalar operators?

</front>

<back>

- `>` (Folded): Replaces newlines with spaces. Useful for long text paragraphs you want to keep on one line in the UI.
- `|` (Literal): Preserves newlines and formatting. Required for complex Markdown like lists, code blocks, or headers.
