<front>

You are setting up a new dbt project and receive an error stating the profile could not be found. Given the configuration below, what is the cause?

```yaml
# dbt_project.yml
profile: 'my_analytics'

# profiles.yml
analytics_warehouse:
  target: dev
```

</front>

---

<back>

The profile name defined in `dbt_project.yml` ('my_analytics') does not match the profile name defined in `profiles.yml` ('analytics_warehouse'). To fix this, you must change the `profile` key in `dbt_project.yml` to 'analytics_warehouse'.
