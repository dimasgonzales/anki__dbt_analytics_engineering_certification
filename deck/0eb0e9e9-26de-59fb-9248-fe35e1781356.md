What does it mean that dbt uses a 'declarative' approach to database object creation?

It means you define the desired *outcome* (e.g., the data selection logic and the configuration `materialized='table'`) rather than the steps to get there. dbt's adapters automatically generate and execute the specific DDL (Data Definition Language) required to create or replace the object in your warehouse.
