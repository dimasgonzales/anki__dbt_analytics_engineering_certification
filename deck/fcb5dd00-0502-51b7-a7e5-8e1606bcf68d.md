<front>

Your BI dashboard is timing out because the underlying dbt model takes too long to query. The model is currently a `view`. How should you change the materialization to fix this, and why?

<back>

Change the materialization to **table** (or `incremental` if the data volume is massive).

```sql
{{ config(materialized='table') }}
```

This shifts the processing time to the dbt build step, allowing the BI tool to query pre-computed results instantly.
