<front>

You try to run dbt and receive the error: `Could not find profile named 'analytics_prod'`. What is the likely cause and how do you fix it?

</front>

<back>

The `profile` defined in your `dbt_project.yml` does not match any top-level entry in your `profiles.yml` file.

To fix this, ensure the value in `dbt_project.yml` exactly matches the profile name defined in `~/.dbt/profiles.yml`.

```yaml
# dbt_project.yml
profile: analytics_prod # Must exist in profiles.yml
```
