<front>

You have the following configuration in `dbt_project.yml`:
```yaml
models:
  jaffle_shop:
    marketing:
      +materialized: view
      paid_ads:
        +materialized: table
```
How will a model located in `models/marketing/paid_ads/` be materialized?

</front>

<back>

It will be materialized as a **table**. 

dbt configurations cascade, meaning settings defined in a deeper subdirectory (child) override settings defined in parent directories. Even though `marketing` specifies `view`, the more specific `paid_ads` configuration takes precedence.
