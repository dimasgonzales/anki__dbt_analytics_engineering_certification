  explanation: "The reference text states that without a `unique_key`, incremental models typically use append-only behavior, and mentions that `unique_key` is used in some strategies like merge. However, it does not explicitly confirm the specific effect described in the answer, such as changing to a merge/upsert strategy or detailing the process of checking matches and updating/inserting rows based on `unique_key`. The text lacks sufficient information to verify the exact claims in the answer."

<front>

In an incremental model, what is the specific effect of defining a `unique_key` configuration?

<back>

It changes the incremental strategy from append-only to a merge/upsert strategy. dbt checks if records in the new batch match existing records based on the `unique_key`; if they match, the existing row is updated; otherwise, the new row is inserted.
