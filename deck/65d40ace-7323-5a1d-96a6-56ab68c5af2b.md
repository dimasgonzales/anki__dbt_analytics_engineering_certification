<front>

You need to apply a GRANT statement in a post-hook, but only if the model is materialized as a table. How would you accomplish this using the `model` object?

<back>

You would check the `model.config.materialized` property inside an `if` block within your hook configuration.

Example:
```sql
post_hook="""
  {% if model.config.materialized == 'table' %}
    GRANT SELECT ON {{ this }} TO ROLE reporter
  {% endif %}
"""
```

</back>
