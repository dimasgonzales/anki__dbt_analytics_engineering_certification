What does the `dbt run` command do?

</front>

<back>

`dbt run` executes compiled sql model files against the current target database. dbt connects to the target database and runs the relevant SQL required to materialize all data models using the specified materialization strategies. Models are run in the order defined by the dependency graph generated during compilation. Intelligent multi-threading is used to minimize execution time without violating dependencies.

Deploying new models frequently involves destroying prior versions of these models. In these cases, dbt run minimizes the amount of time in which a model is unavailable by first building each model with a temporary name, then dropping the existing model, then renaming the model to its correct name. The drop and rename happen within a single database transaction for database adapters that support transactions.

If you provide the `--full-refresh` flag, incremental models will be treated as tables and rebuilt from scratch.

Specific subsets of resources can be run using dbt's standard selection syntax.
