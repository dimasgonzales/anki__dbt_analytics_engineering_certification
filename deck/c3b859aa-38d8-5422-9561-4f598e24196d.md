<front>

You want to limit a model to process only 100 rows when running in your local development environment to save time, but process all rows in production. How would you implement this?

Use a Jinja `if` statement checking the `target.name` variable at the end of your SQL file.

Example:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM {{ ref('orders') }}
{% if target.name == 'dev' %}
  LIMIT 100
{% endif %}
```
