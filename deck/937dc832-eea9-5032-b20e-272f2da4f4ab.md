<front>

You have configured a dependency on the 'analytics' project in `dependencies.yml`. How do you reference the model `fct_orders` from that upstream project in your SQL?

</front>

<back>

Use the two-argument syntax for the `ref()` function. The first argument is the project name, and the second is the model name.

Example:
```sql
select * from {{ ref('analytics', 'fct_orders') }}
```

</back>
