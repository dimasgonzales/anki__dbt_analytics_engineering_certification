  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that the `insert_overwrite` strategy requires a partition clause, confirming that `partitioned_by` configuration is necessary, as indicated in the answer."

    quote: "The `insert_overwrite` strategy generates a merge statement that replaces entire partitions in the destination table. **Note:** this configuration requires that the model is configured with a Partition clause."

<front>

In dbt-athena, what configuration is strictly required to use the `insert_overwrite` incremental strategy?

<back>

You must configure `partitioned_by`. Without partitions, dbt will default to the `append` strategy even if `insert_overwrite` is specified in the config.
```sql
partitioned_by=['date_col']
```
