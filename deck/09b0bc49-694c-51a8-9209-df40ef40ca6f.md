<front>

You have two CSV files: a 500MB file of raw transaction logs and a 50KB file of department codes. Which one should be implemented as a dbt seed and why?

Only the 50KB department codes file should be a seed. Seeds are best practice for small, static reference data that benefits from version control. Large datasets (like the 500MB transaction file) should be loaded via an EL tool because seeds perform poorly at scale and bloat the git repository.
