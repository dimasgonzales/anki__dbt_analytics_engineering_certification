  explanation: "The reference text does not provide specific information on how dbt determines the latest version when the 'latest_version' property is omitted. It discusses model version definitions, file naming conventions, and version identifiers but lacks explicit details on comparing versions numerically or alphabetically to identify the latest."

<front>

How does dbt determine the `latest_version` of a model if the `latest_version` property is omitted from the configuration?

<back>

dbt defaults to the version with the **largest identifier**.

dbt compares the defined versions (numerically or alphabetically) and automatically treats the highest one as the `latest_version` for unpinned references.
