<front>

You are developing a dbt package and have created a subdirectory named `integration_tests` to test your changes. How do you configure the test project to use the package code from the parent directory?

</front>

---

<back>

In the `integration_tests/packages.yml` file, reference the parent package using a relative path with the `local` key.

This mimics an installation and allows you to run `dbt deps` in the test directory to link the code.

Example:
```yaml
packages:
  - local: ../
```

</back>
