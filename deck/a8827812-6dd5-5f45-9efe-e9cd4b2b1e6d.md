  explanation: "The Reference Text provides information on model versions and their YAML structure but does not specify how dbt determines the latest version when not configured or how ref() resolves versions, so the answer cannot be verified."

<front>

How does dbt determine the 'latest_version' of a model if it is not explicitly configured in the YAML properties?

</front>

<back>

dbt automatically treats the version with the **highest identifier** (numeric or string) as the latest version by default. 

Consequently, calls to `{{ ref('model_name') }}` without a version argument will resolve to this highest version.
