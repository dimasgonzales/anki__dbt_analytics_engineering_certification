<front>

How does dbt determine the 'latest_version' of a model if it is not explicitly configured in the YAML properties?

<back>

dbt automatically treats the version with the **highest identifier** (numeric or string) as the latest version by default. 

Consequently, calls to `{{ ref('model_name') }}` without a version argument will resolve to this highest version.
