  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer accurately states that package-lock.yml records exact versions and git hashes to ensure deterministic installations. The reference text explicitly supports this by describing the file as containing a record of installed packages, pinning to specific commits for git-based dependencies, and ensuring consistent and repeatable installs across environments."

<back>

It records the exact versions (and git hashes) of installed packages. This ensures **deterministic** installations, meaning subsequent `dbt deps` runs in different environments (like Prod or CI) will install the exact same code.
