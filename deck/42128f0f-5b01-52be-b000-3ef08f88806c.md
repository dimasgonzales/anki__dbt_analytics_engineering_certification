  explanation: "The Reference Text does not contain any information about the syntax for creating variables in models or the use of delimiters like `{% ... %}` or `{{ ... }}`. It focuses on model columns, logs, and programmatic interfaces without addressing assignment statements or Jinja templating."

<front>

You want to create a variable inside a model to hold a list of status codes, but you do not want this assignment to appear in the final SQL query. Which syntax should you use?

<back>

You should use the **Statement** delimiter `{% ... %}`.

Example:
```sql
{% set status_codes = ['active', 'pending'] %}
```
Using double curly braces `{{ ... }}` would attempt to print the result of the assignment statement, resulting in invalid SQL.
