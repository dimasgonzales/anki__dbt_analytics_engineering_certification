<front>

A dashboard powered by a dbt model containing multiple heavy joins is timing out for end users. The model is currently materialized as a view. How do you resolve this?

<back>

Change the materialization strategy to `table` (or `incremental` for large datasets) in the config block. This pre-computes the heavy joins during the dbt run.
```sql
{{ config(
    materialized='table'
) }}
```
