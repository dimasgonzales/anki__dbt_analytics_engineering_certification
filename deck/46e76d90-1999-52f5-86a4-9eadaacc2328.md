<front>

You run the following command on a `dbt-spark` project to speed up documentation generation:

```bash
dbt docs generate --select models/staging
```

However, the command takes the same amount of time as a full generation. Why?

The `dbt-spark` adapter (unlike Snowflake or BigQuery) does not support partial catalog generation. Even though the `--select` flag was used, the adapter falls back to building the full catalog for the entire project.
