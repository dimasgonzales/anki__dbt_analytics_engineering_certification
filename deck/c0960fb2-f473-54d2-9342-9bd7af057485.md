<front>

Your downstream BI tool cannot find a newly created metric, even though the dbt job completed successfully. If you suspect the definition file is missing, which file should you look for in the build artifacts?

<back>

You should check for `target/semantic_manifest.json`. If this file was not generated or is corrupt, the Semantic Layer will not know about the new metric definitions, even if the underlying table models were built successfully.
