  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer is supported by explicit statements in the reference text, which confirm that the 'dbt parse' command parses and validates the dbt project, fails on syntax errors, produces detailed timing information, has partial parsing enabled by default, and is configurable via the PARTIAL_PARSE global config."

What does the `dbt parse` command do?

</front>

<back>

It parses your dbt project: reconstructing the project manifest, infering dependencies, constructing the resulting DAG, and (finally) writing out detailed timing information about the parsing process. If your project contains Jinja or YAML syntax errors, the command will fail.  
  
Since v1.0 *partial parsing* is on by default, meaning dbt will only parse files that have changed since the last parse run. This option can be configured using the PARTIAL\_PARSE global config.
