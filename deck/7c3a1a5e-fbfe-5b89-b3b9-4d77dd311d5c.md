<front>

You are debugging a complex macro and need to see the value of a specific variable during the compilation phase. How would you accomplish this?

Add a `{{ print() }}` statement inside the macro containing the variable you wish to inspect. When you run a command like `dbt compile` or `dbt run`, the value will be displayed in your terminal and recorded in `logs/dbt.log`.

```jinja
{% macro calculate_stuff(val) %}
  {{ print('Debug val: ' ~ val) }}
  ...
{% endmacro %}
```

</back>
