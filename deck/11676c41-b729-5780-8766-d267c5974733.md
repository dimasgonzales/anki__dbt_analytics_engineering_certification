<front>

You have defined a materialization named `custom_table` with two implementations: one for `default` and one for `adapter='redshift'`. 

If you run this model against a **Snowflake** data warehouse, which implementation will dbt execute?

<back>

dbt will execute the **`default`** implementation.

Since there is no Snowflake-specific implementation defined (`adapter='snowflake'`), dbt's adapter dispatch logic falls back to the generic `default` block logic.
