<front>

You have a model with complex incremental logic:

```sql
{% if is_incremental() %}
  WHERE event_time > (SELECT MAX(event_time) FROM {{ this }})
{% endif %}
```

You want to verify the SQL generated for an incremental run without executing the query against the warehouse. How do you do this?

Click the **Compile** button in the IDE (or run `dbt compile`).

This renders the SQL based on the current context, allowing you to see if the `WHERE` clause is included and correctly formatted for the target dialect without incurring the cost of running the query.
