<front>

You have a semantic model for 'transactions' and another for 'customers'. Both models have a dimension named 'status'. How do you reference the transaction status in a downstream metric query to avoid ambiguity?

You must scope the dimension to its specific entity using the fully qualified name. In this case, you would reference:

```
transactions__status
```
