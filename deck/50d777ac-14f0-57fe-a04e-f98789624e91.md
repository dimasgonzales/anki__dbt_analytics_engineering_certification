<front>

What CLI flag must be used to completely drop and rebuild an incremental model?

</front>

<back>

The `--full-refresh` flag. This forces dbt to ignore the `is_incremental()` logic, drop the existing relation in the database, and rebuild the table from scratch using all source data.

```bash
dbt run --full-refresh
```
