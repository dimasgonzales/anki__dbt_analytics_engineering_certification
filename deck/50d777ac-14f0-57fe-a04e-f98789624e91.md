  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly mentions the 'full-refresh' in the context of incremental models, indicating that using the --full-refresh flag forces a complete rebuild, which aligns with the answer's description of dropping and rebuilding the table."

<front>

What CLI flag must be used to completely drop and rebuild an incremental model?

<back>

The `--full-refresh` flag. This forces dbt to ignore the `is_incremental()` logic, drop the existing relation in the database, and rebuild the table from scratch using all source data.

```bash
dbt run --full-refresh
```
