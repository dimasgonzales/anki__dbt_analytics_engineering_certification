You need to configure `fct_revenue` as a `public` model so other projects can consume it. What configuration is mandatory for this to work?

You must enforce a model contract. dbt requires all `public` models to have an enforced contract to ensure a stable interface for cross-project dependencies.

```yaml
config:
  access: public
  contract: { enforced: true }
```
