  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that the 'dbt source freshness' command queries source tables to determine freshness and reports warnings or errors based on the results, which aligns with populating the execution state as described in the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "The `dbt source freshness` command will query all of your defined source tables, determining the 'freshness' of these tables. If the tables are stale (based on the `freshness` config specified for your sources) then dbt will report a warning or error accordingly."

The `dbt source freshness` command.

It queries the database to check the `loaded_at_field` against the defined freshness criteria and populates the source status based on the results.
