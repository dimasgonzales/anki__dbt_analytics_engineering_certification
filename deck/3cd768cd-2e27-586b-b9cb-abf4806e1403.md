What is the difference between the files found in `target/compiled/` and `target/run/`?

<back>

`target/compiled/` contains the raw **SELECT** statements (Jinja rendered into SQL).

`target/run/` contains the final **DDL** (e.g., `CREATE VIEW...` or `CREATE TABLE...`) that dbt actually executes against the warehouse.
