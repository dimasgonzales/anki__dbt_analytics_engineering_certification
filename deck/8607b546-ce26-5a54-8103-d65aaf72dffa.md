  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly states that dbt data tests are SQL queries (select statements) and that a test passes if it returns zero failing rows, which directly supports the Answer's condition for passing and failing. The additional detail about a 'select count(*)' wrapper is not mentioned but does not contradict the text."

    quote: "If the data test returns zero failing rows, it passes, and your assertion has been validated."

<front>

What condition determines if a dbt data test passes or fails?

<back>

In dbt, a test is a SQL query. The test **passes** if the query returns **zero rows**. The test **fails** if the query returns **one or more rows**. dbt effectively runs a `select count(*)` wrapper around your test query to check this.
