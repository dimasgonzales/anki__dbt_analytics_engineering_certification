<front>

What happens during `dbt build` if a model's actual data output conflicts with its defined model contract (e.g., a column is missing or has the wrong data type)?

The build fails for that model. 

Model contracts with `enforced: true` provide a hard guarantee at build time. Unlike tests which might just warn, a contract violation prevents the model from successfully building to ensure downstream reliability.
