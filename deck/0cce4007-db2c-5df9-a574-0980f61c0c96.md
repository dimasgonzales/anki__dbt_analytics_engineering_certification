Which specific key in the `dbt_project.yml` file establishes the link between the project and the connection credentials?

The `profile` key.

This key specifies the profile name that dbt will look for in your local `profiles.yml` file to find connection details (host, user, password, etc.).

Example:
```yaml
name: my_project
profile: my_snowflake_db
```
