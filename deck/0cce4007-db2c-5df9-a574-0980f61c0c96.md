  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that dbt reads the dbt_project.yml file to find the profile name, which is then used to locate connection details in the profiles.yml file, directly supporting the answer that the 'profile' key establishes this link."

<front>

Which specific key in the `dbt_project.yml` file establishes the link between the project and the connection credentials?

<back>

The `profile` key.

This key specifies the profile name that dbt will look for in your local `profiles.yml` file to find connection details (host, user, password, etc.).

Example:
```yaml
name: my_project
profile: my_snowflake_db
```
