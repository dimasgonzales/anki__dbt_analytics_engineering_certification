<front>

You want to run only the `unique` tests, but strictly for your `incremental` models to save time. How would you execute this using `dbt test`?

You should use an intersection (comma) of the `test_name` and `config.materialized` selectors.

Command:
```bash
dbt test --select "test_name:unique,config.materialized:incremental"
```
