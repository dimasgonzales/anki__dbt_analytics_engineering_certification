claim_meta:
  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text confirms that dbt tests can be applied beyond models by mentioning selection syntax for commands like test and including sources as selectable resources. However, it does not explicitly state that seeds and snapshots can be tested, so the full claim in the answer cannot be verified."

    quote: "Note that the following arguments (`--select`, `--exclude`, and `--selector`) also apply to other dbt tasks, such as `test` and `build`."

**False**. You can test models, sources, seeds, and snapshots using the same kinds of generic and singular tests.
