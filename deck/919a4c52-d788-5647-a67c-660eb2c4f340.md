  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that the `ref()` function in dbt is used to infer dependencies for correct build order and ensure selection from the same environment, which directly supports both functions listed in the answer: dependency management and environment interpolation."
  citation:
    quote: "Using the `ref` function allows dbt to infer dependencies, ensuring that models are built in the correct order. It also ensures that your current model selects from upstream tables and views in the same environment that you're working in."

<front>

What are the two primary functions of the `ref()` macro in dbt?

1. **Dependency Management:** It builds the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) by telling dbt that the current model depends on the referenced model.
2. **Environment Interpolation:** It compiles to the correct database.schema.table name based on the current target configuration (e.g., dev vs. prod).
