  explanation: "The reference text confirms that dbt Cloud environment-level permissions are not granular and do not allow specifying access to only trigger job runs without edit permissions, as granting access to an environment provides control over all resources."

In dbt Cloud, is it possible to grant a user permission to trigger job runs in an environment without giving them permission to edit the job definitions?

No. Permissions are applied at the **Environment Type** level and are not granular regarding resources. Granting write access to an environment gives the user control over **all** resources, meaning they can both create/edit jobs and trigger runs.
