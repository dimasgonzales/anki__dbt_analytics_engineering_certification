In dbt Cloud, is it possible to grant a user permission to trigger job runs in an environment without giving them permission to edit the job definitions?

No. Permissions are applied at the **Environment Type** level and are not granular regarding resources. Granting write access to an environment gives the user control over **all** resources, meaning they can both create/edit jobs and trigger runs.
