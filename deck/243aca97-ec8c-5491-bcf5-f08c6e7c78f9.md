<front>

When `dbtRunner` (with a Python script) executes `dbt test` and returns `success=False` with `exception=None`, what does this signify about the dbt exit code?

<back>

This indicates a **Handled Error** (Exit Code 1). It means the dbt process completed successfully, but one or more configured data tests failed.

If `exception` were populated, it would signify a **Critical Crash/Unhandled Error** (Exit Code 2).
