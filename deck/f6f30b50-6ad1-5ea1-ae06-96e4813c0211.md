<front>

You have a complex business definition for "Gross Margin" that applies to 15 different models. How can you apply the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to this documentation?

<back>

Define the description once in a `.md` file using a docs block, then reference it in every model's `schema.yml` entry using the `{{ doc('...') }}` function.

```sql
-- docs/margins.md
{% docs gross_margin %}
Calculated as (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue
{% enddocs %}
```
