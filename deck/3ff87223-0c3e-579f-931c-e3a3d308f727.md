  explanation: "Step 1 of the answer regarding the order of gathering resources is explicitly supported by the reference text. However, steps 2 and 3, which describe the types of resources (models, sources, seeds, snapshots, tests) and the final filtering based on task type (e.g., only seeds for dbt seed), are not found in the provided evidence. The reference text does not contain sufficient information to verify these parts of the answer."

    quote: "1. dbt gathers all the resources that are matched by one or more of the `--select` criteria, in the order of [selection methods](/reference/node-selection/methods) (e.g. `tag:`), then [graph operators](/reference/node-selection/graph-operators) (e.g. `+`), then finally set operators ([unions](/reference/node-selection/set-operators#unions), [intersections](/reference/node-selection/set-operators#intersections), [exclusions](/reference/node-selection/exclude))."

What is the "order of operations" for dbt node selection?

<back>

1. dbt gathers all the resources that are matched by one or more of the `--select` criteria, in the order of selection methods (e.g. `tag:`), then graph operators (e.g. `+`), then finally set operators (unions, intersections, exclusions).
2. The selected resources may be models, sources, seeds, snapshots, tests. (Tests can also be selected "indirectly" via their parents)
3. dbt now has a list of still-selected resources of varying types. As a final step, it tosses away any resource that does not match the resource type of the current task. (Only seeds are kept for `dbt seed`, only models for `dbt run`, only tests for `dbt test`, and so on.)
