<front>

You have a 2GB CSV file of historical transaction data that needs to be loaded into your warehouse for a dbt project. How should you handle this?

</front>

<back>

You should load this via an external stage or EL tool and define it as a **Source** in dbt. You should **not** use `dbt seed`. `dbt seed` is generally limited to files < 1MB or ~1000 rows and is not performant or designed for large raw data ingestion.
