According to dbt best practices, should the directory defined in `packages-install-path` be committed to version control?

No, it should generally be excluded.

The package directory (e.g., `dbt_packages`) contains artifacts generated at runtime. Excluding it ensures your repository stays lightweight and forces a clean installation of dependencies via `dbt deps` in different environments.
