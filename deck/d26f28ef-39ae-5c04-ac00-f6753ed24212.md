  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly supports the answer: Model Timing is described as a tool to identify bottlenecks in models by monitoring execution times, and Query Profile is described as a tool for troubleshooting and analyzing slow queries by examining execution metrics."
  citation:
    quote: "Data teams can monitor the performance of their models, identify bottlenecks, and optimize the overall data pipeline by fetching execution details like `executionTime` and `runElapsedTime`."
