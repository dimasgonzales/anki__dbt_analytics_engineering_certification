<front>

You have a large dataset where uniqueness is defined by a combination of 5 different columns. Creating a concatenated string in SQL is messy and you want a clean YAML configuration. What is the best approach?

<back>

Use the `dbt_utils.unique_combination_of_columns` test.

This is often more performant than string manipulation on large datasets and keeps the YAML readable by listing columns explicitly rather than embedding SQL logic in the test configuration.
