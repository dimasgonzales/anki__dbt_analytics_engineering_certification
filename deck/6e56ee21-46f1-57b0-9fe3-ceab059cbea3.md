<front>

You are building a dbt package that contains a model specifically designed for Snowflake architecture. How do you prevent this model from being built when the package is installed on a Redshift project?

</front>

<back>

Use the `enabled` configuration combined with `target.type` checking.

You can configure this in the `dbt_project.yml` or the model's config block.

Example:
```yaml
models:
  my_package:
    snowflake_specific_model:
      enabled: "{{ target.type == 'snowflake' }}"
```

</back>
