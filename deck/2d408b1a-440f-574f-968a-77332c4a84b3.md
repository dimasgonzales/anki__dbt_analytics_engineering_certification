<front>

You need to ensure all models within the `models/marts/finance` directory belong to the 'finance' group without configuring each file individually. How would you accomplish this in `dbt_project.yml`?

<back>

Navigate to the specific folder hierarchy under the `models` key in `dbt_project.yml` and apply the `+group` configuration to that directory scope.

```yaml
models:
  my_project:
    marts:
      finance:
        +group: finance
```

</back>
