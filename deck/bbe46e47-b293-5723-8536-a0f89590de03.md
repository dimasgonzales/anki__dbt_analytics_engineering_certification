<front>

You have a versioned model `dim_customers` with versions `v1` and `v2`. You define a unit test for `dim_customers` without specifying a `versions` config. How will dbt execute this test?

</front>

---

<back>

dbt will execute the unit test against both `v1` and `v2`.

Unless explicitly scoped using `include` or `exclude`, unit tests apply to all versions of the model by default.
