  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that when the --full-refresh flag is used, is_incremental() returns false, overriding the normal conditions for incremental behavior, and triggers a full rebuild by dropping and recreating the table, which aligns with the answer."

What is the specific behavior of the `is_incremental()` macro when the command `dbt run --full-refresh` is executed?

<back>

The `is_incremental()` macro returns `false`, regardless of whether the table exists or is configured as incremental. This bypasses the incremental filter logic, drops the existing table, and rebuilds it entirely from scratch.
