<front>

A complex model with multiple transformation steps is failing logic tests. How can you use the Functional CTE structure to troubleshoot the specific step causing the error?

<back>

Temporarily modify the final line of the model to select from an intermediate CTE (e.g., `select * from step_2`) rather than the final CTE. Run or compile the model to inspect the data state at that specific point in the transformation pipeline.

Example:
```sql
...
final as (
   select * from step_3
)
-- select * from final
select * from step_2 -- Debugging step 2
```
