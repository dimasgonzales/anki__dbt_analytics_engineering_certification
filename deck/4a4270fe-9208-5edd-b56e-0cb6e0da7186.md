  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer is supported by the reference text, which explicitly states that groups assign shared ownership to models, enable access control by designating private and public access, and facilitate cross-project collaboration as part of dbt Mesh."
  citation:
    quote: "Models can be grouped under a common designation with a shared owner. ... It enables you to designate certain models as having 'private' access—for use exclusively within that group."

<back>

It defines collections of models to assign **ownership** (e.g., team emails) and establish **access control contracts** (public vs. private models) for cross-project collaboration (dbt Mesh).
