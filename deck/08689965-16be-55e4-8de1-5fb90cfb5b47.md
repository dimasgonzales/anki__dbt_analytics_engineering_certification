  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that `result:fail` is specific to test nodes for re-running failed tests, while `result:error` selects any resource (models, tests, snapshots, etc.) that returned an error, and both require prior run results as indicated by the need for `--state`."
  citation:
    quote: "Only use `result:fail` when you want to re-run tests that failed during the last invocation. This selector is specific to test nodes. Tests don't have downstream nodes in the DAG, so using the `result:fail+` selector will only return the failed test itself and not the model or anything built on top of it. On the other hand, `result:error` selects any resource (models, tests, snapshots, and more) that returned an error."

<front>

In dbt selectors, what is the difference between `result:fail` and `result:error`?

<back>

`result:fail` selects test resources that failed their assertions (e.g., a `unique` test found duplicates). `result:error` selects resources (models, snapshots, or tests) that encountered a runtime exception or database error during execution.

Both require a local `run_results.json` or one provided via `--state`.
