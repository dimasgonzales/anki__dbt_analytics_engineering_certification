<front>

In dbt selectors, what is the difference between `result:fail` and `result:error`?

</front>

<back>

`result:fail` selects test resources that failed their assertions (e.g., a `unique` test found duplicates). `result:error` selects resources (models, snapshots, or tests) that encountered a runtime exception or database error during execution.

Both require a local `run_results.json` or one provided via `--state`.
