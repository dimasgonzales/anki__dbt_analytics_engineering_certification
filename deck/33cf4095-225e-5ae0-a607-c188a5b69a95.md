<front>

You have documented `user_id` in `stg_users.yml`. In `dim_users`, you select `user_id` as-is. To adhere to DRY principles, how should you configure `dim_users.yml` for this column?

</front>

<back>

You should omit the `user_id` column configuration in `dim_users.yml`. dbt will automatically propagate the description from `stg_users` to `dim_users` because it is recognized as a passthrough column.
