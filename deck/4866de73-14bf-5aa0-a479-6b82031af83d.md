  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly mentions that `grants` is the configuration key in dbt used to manage database privileges such as SELECT or INSERT for specific roles or users, which directly supports the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "You can configure `grants` in `dbt_project.yml` to apply grants to many resources at once—all models in your project, a package, or a subfolder—and you can also configure `grants` one-by-one for specific resources, in YAML `config:` blocks or right within their `.sql` files."

<front>

Which configuration key is used in dbt to natively manage database privileges (such as SELECT or INSERT) for specific roles or users?

</front>

<back>

The `grants` configuration key. It allows you to define a dictionary of privileges and the lists of roles/users that should possess them.

Example:
```yaml
grants:
  select: ['reporter_role']
```
