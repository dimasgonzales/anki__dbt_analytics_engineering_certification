You want a model to limit the number of rows processed during development runs to save costs, but process full history in production. How do you implement this?

Use the `target` variable to check the profile name (e.g., 'dev') and apply a limit conditionally.

Example:
```sql
select * from {{ source('raw', 'events') }}
{% if target.name == 'dev' %}
  limit 1000
{% endif %}
```
