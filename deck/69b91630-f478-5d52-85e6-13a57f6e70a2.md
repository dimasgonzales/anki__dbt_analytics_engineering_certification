<front>

A colleague suggests that a dbt project is failing to run specifically because `config-version: 2` is missing from the `dbt_project.yml` file. Is this diagnosis correct?

No, this diagnosis is likely incorrect. The absence of `config-version` does **not** cause a compilation error because dbt implicitly defaults to version 2. The failure is likely due to a different configuration error.
