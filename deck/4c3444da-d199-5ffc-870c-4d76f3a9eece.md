  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The Reference Text does not contain information about the directory structure for snapshots (such as the `snapshots/` directory or `.sql` files) or the specific Jinja block syntax required (`{% snapshot ... %}`). While it mentions `snapshots.yml` in the context of using Jinja, this does not directly address the Answer's claims about where snapshots must be defined and their syntax."

<front>

Where in the dbt project directory structure must snapshots be defined, and what Jinja block syntax is required?

</front>

<back>

Snapshots must be defined in **.sql** files within the **`snapshots/`** directory (not `models/`).

The logic must be wrapped in a specific snapshot block:
```sql
{% snapshot snapshot_name %}
    ...
{% endsnapshot %}
```

</back>
