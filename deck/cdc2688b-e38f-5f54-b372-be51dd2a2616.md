What is the dbt function used to reference raw database tables, and what are its two required arguments?

The `{{ source() }}` function. It requires two arguments: the **source name** and the **table name** (as defined in a `.yml` file).

Example:
```sql
FROM {{ source('jaffle_shop', 'orders') }}
```
