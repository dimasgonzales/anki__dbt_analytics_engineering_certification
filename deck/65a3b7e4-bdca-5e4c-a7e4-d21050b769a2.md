<front>

You are setting up the dbt Cloud CLI locally. You have authenticated successfully, but when you run commands, dbt cannot associate your local code with the remote Cloud project. What configuration is likely missing?

<back>

You are likely missing the `dbt-cloud` configuration block in your `dbt_project.yml` file. This block must contain the `project-id` to link the local project code to the specific dbt Cloud project.

```yaml
dbt-cloud:
  project-id: 123456
```
