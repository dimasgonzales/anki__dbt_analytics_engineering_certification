claim_meta:
  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that Python models can only be materialized as tables or incremental models, implying that other materializations like snapshot are unsupported. However, the text does not mention dbt-athena or the Spark engine specifically, but the core claim about materialization types is supported."

<front>

What specific materialization type is currently unsupported for Python models in dbt-athena?

<back>

Python models cannot use the `snapshot` materialization. They generally support `table` and `incremental` materializations running on the Spark engine.
