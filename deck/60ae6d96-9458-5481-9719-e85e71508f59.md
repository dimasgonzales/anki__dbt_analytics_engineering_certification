<front>

You have a `scripts/` directory inside your `models/` folder containing Python files that are causing dbt parsing errors. You want to keep the files there but prevent dbt from reading them. How do you do this?

<back>

Add the directory path to a `.dbtignore` file in the root of your dbt project.

```text
# .dbtignore
models/scripts/
```

</back>
