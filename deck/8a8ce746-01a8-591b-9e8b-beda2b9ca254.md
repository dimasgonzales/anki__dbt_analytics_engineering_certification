How do you select all parents and/or children of a selected model? How do you limit the *number* of parents/children selected?

The **+** operator. It selects parents when preceding an identifier, and children when following:  
```
$ dbt run --select my\_model+ # select my\_model and all children
$ dbt run --select +my\_model # select my\_model and all parents
$ dbt run --select +my\_model+ # select my\_model, and all of its parents and children
```Adding a positive integer to the "outer-facing" side of the "+" operator limits the number selected:  
```
$ dbt run --select my\_model+1 # select my\_model and its first-degree children
$ dbt run --select 2+my\_model # select my\_model, its first-degree parents, and its second-degree parents ("grandparents")
$ dbt run --select 3+my\_model+4 # select my\_model, its parents up to the 3rd degree, and its children down to the 4th degree
```
