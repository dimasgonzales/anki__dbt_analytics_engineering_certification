  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer correctly describes the use of the '+' operator to select ancestors (parents) and descendants (children) in dbt graph selection, and the 'n-plus' operator with integers to limit the degrees, which is explicitly supported by the reference text."
  citation:
    quote: "From the reference: 'You can adjust the behavior of the `+` operator by quantifying the number of edges to step through. dbt run --select \"my_model+1\" # select my_model and its first-degree descendants  dbt run --select \"2+my_model\" # select my_model, its first-degree ancestors (\"parents\"), and its second-degree ancestors (\"grandparents\")  dbt run --select \"3+my_model+4\" # select my_model, its ancestors up to the 3rd degree, and its descendants down to the 4th degree'"

How do you select all parents and/or children of a selected model? How do you limit the *number* of parents/children selected?

The **+** operator. It selects parents when preceding an identifier, and children when following:  
```
$ dbt run --select my\_model+ # select my\_model and all children
$ dbt run --select +my\_model # select my\_model and all parents
$ dbt run --select +my\_model+ # select my\_model, and all of its parents and children
```Adding a positive integer to the "outer-facing" side of the "+" operator limits the number selected:  
```
$ dbt run --select my\_model+1 # select my\_model and its first-degree children
$ dbt run --select 2+my\_model # select my\_model, its first-degree parents, and its second-degree parents ("grandparents")
$ dbt run --select 3+my\_model+4 # select my\_model, its parents up to the 3rd degree, and its children down to the 4th degree
```
