  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that in dbt's structured logging schema, every log event has two top-level keys: 'info' and 'data', which aligns with the answer provided. The description of these keys in the answer matches the evidence, as 'info' contains common metadata and 'data' holds event-specific structured information."

In dbt's structured logging schema, what are the two top-level keys present in every log event?

<back>

The two keys are:
1. `info`: Contains metadata about the event (e.g., `invocation_id`, `level`, `ts`).
2. `data`: Contains the context-specific payload (e.g., query results, error details).
