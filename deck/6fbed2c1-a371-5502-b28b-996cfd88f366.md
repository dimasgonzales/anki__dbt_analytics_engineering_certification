What feature in dbt Cloud allows you to automatically start a job immediately after a specific upstream job completes?

The **Run when another job finishes** trigger.

This feature enables **Event-Based Orchestration**, allowing you to chain jobs together (even across different dbt projects) to create a dependency DAG. You can specify that the downstream job only runs if the upstream job completes with a specific status (e.g., 'Success').
