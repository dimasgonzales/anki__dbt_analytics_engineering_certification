<front>

What are the three primary Redshift distribution styles available in dbt and when should you use `dist='all'`?

</front>

<back>

The three styles are `even` (round-robin), `key` (specific column), and `all` (replication). You should use `dist='all'` for small, slowly changing reference or lookup tables to replicate the full table on every node, which speeds up joins against larger tables.
