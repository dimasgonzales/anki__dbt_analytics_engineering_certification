<front>

You are investigating a data quality issue and need to identify every model that is downstream of BOTH `stg_stripe_payments` AND `stg_shopify_orders`. What command isolates these shared descendants?

Use the downstream graph operator (`+` suffix) combined with the comma intersection operator.

Command:
```bash
dbt ls --select stg_stripe_payments+,stg_shopify_orders+
```

</back>
