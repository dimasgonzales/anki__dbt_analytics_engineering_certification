<front>

You want to check the freshness of a massive source table in Snowflake, but you want to avoid the cost and time of scanning the table for a timestamp. How should you configure the source?

You should omit the `loaded_at_field` in your source configuration. On Snowflake, if `loaded_at_field` is not provided, dbt defaults to checking the warehouse metadata (information schema) for the table's last modified time, which is significantly faster and cheaper.
