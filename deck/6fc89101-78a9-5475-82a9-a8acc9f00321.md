What is the specific order of precedence dbt uses when resolving environment variables, from highest to lowest?

<back>

The order of precedence is:
1. **Job or Personal Overrides** (Highest priority)
2. **Environment Level** variables
3. **Project Level** variables
4. **Default value** provided in the code (Lowest priority)

This ensures that specific runtime configurations override general defaults.
