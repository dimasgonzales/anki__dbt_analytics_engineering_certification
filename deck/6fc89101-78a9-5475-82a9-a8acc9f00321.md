  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly lists the same four levels in the identical order of precedence for dbt environment variables as stated in the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "allowing users to define values at four levels (highest to lowest order of precedence): * The job level (job override) or in the Studio IDE for an individual developer (personal override). *Highest precedence* * The environment level, which can be overridden by the job level or personal override. * A project-wide default value, which can be overridden by the environment level, job level, or personal override. * The optional default argument supplied to the `env_var` Jinja function in the code. *Lowest precedence*"

<front>

What is the specific order of precedence dbt uses when resolving environment variables, from highest to lowest?

<back>

The order of precedence is:
1. **Job or Personal Overrides** (Highest priority)
2. **Environment Level** variables
3. **Project Level** variables
4. **Default value** provided in the code (Lowest priority)

This ensures that specific runtime configurations override general defaults.
