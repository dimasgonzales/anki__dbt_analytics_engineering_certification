  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly confirms that dbt assumes version 2 syntax by default and that version 1 is deprecated, which directly supports the Answer's recommendation to refactor the file to align with version 2."
  citation:
    quote: "Without this configuration, dbt will assume your `dbt_project.yml` uses the version 2 syntax. Version 1 has been deprecated."
