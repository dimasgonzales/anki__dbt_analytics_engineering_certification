What happens when you run dbt tests with the `--store-failures` flag?

</front>

<back>

dbt runs the test queries and saves the **actual failing records** into a table in the database. This allows you to query the table directly to analyze the bad data that caused the test to fail.

By default, the table is created in a schema named `{{ profile.schema }}_dbt_test__audit`. This schema name includes a dynamic prefix based on your dbt profile's default schema.
