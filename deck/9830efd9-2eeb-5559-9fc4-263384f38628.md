  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text confirms that the ref() function can accept two arguments—packagename and modelname—for cross-project references, aligning with the answer's description of using project name and model name. This supports the syntax change described for referencing models across separate dbt projects."
  citation:
    quote: "call the `builtins.ref()` function with either a single `modelname` argument or both `packagename` and `modelname` arguments"

How does the syntax of the `ref()` function change when referencing a model from a separate dbt project in a dbt Mesh architecture?

<back>

When referencing a model across projects, `ref()` requires two arguments: the **project name** and the **model name**. Standard references only require the model name.

Example:
```sql
select * from {{ ref('marketing_project', 'stg_campaigns') }}
```
