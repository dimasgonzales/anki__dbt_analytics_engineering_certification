<front>

You have a macro named `grant_production_access` that takes a `role` argument. You need to run this logic as a standalone administrative task. How would you execute this using the CLI?

Use `dbt run-operation` with the `--args` flag:

```bash
dbt run-operation grant_production_access --args '{role: analyst}'
```
