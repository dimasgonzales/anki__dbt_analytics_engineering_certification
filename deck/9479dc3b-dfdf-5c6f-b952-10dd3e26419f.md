<front>

You have a freshness threshold configured at the source level, but one specific table (`lookup_codes`) is static and keeps failing the freshness check. How do you resolve this?

<back>

Disable freshness for that specific table by setting its freshness config to `null`.

```yaml
tables:
  - name: lookup_codes
    config:
      freshness: null
```

</back>
