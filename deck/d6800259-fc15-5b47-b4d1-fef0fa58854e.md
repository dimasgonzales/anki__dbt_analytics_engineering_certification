  explanation: "The reference text discusses the optional use of `version: 2` and `config-version: 2` in YAML files for structural purposes, but does not contain any information about the YAML keys `versions`, `latest_version`, or `deprecation_date` related to model versioning in dbt. Therefore, the answer cannot be verified based on the provided text."
