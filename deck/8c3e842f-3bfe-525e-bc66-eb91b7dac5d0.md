<front>

What two methods on a `Relation` object allow you to change its components or control which parts are rendered in SQL?

1. `replace_path()`: Used to change specific components (e.g., forcing a specific database).
2. `include()`: Used to control which parts (database, schema, identifier) appear in the final SQL string.

Example:
```sql
rel.include(database=false)
```
