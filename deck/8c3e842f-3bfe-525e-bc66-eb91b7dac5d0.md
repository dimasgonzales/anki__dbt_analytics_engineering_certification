  explanation: "The reference text does not mention any methods on a Relation object, including replace_path() or include(). It focuses on materialization processes, database preparation, and SQL comments, which are unrelated to the specific methods in the answer."

<front>

What two methods on a `Relation` object allow you to change its components or control which parts are rendered in SQL?

</front>

<back>

1. `replace_path()`: Used to change specific components (e.g., forcing a specific database).
2. `include()`: Used to control which parts (database, schema, identifier) appear in the final SQL string.

Example:
```sql
rel.include(database=false)
```
