  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Answer is supported by the Reference Text, which explicitly states that 'dbt show' does not materialize results in the data warehouse, and contextually indicates that 'dbt run' involves creating or updating models, aligning with the difference described."

<front>

How does the `dbt show` command differ from `dbt run` regarding the state of the data warehouse?

<back>

`dbt show` compiles and executes the SQL query, printing results to the terminal, but is **ephemeral**—it does NOT create or update tables/views in the warehouse. `dbt run` executes DDL statements to materialize the models permanently in the database.
