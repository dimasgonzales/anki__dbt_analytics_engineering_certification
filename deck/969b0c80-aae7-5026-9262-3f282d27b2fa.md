<front>

You have a 1GB file of raw transaction logs and a small CSV of tax rates. Which one should be implemented as a dbt seed, and why?

Only the tax rates CSV should be a seed. Seeds are designed for small, static reference data and are version controlled. The 1GB file is too large, not performant for this method, and should be loaded via an EL tool and defined as a `source`.
