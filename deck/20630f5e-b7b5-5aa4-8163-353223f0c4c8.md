What is the difference between using `{# ... #}` and `--` when commenting code in a dbt model?

<back>

`{# ... #}` are **Jinja comments**, which are stripped out by the compiler and **do not appear** in the final executable SQL. 

`--` are **SQL comments**, which pass through the compiler and **will appear** in the final SQL run against the data warehouse.
