  explanation: "The reference text does not contain information about Jinja comments (`{# ... #}`) to verify that they are stripped out and do not appear in the final SQL. While SQL comments (`--`) are mentioned in the context of forcing dependencies, the text does not explicitly discuss the difference between Jinja and SQL comments or confirm the behavior described in the answer for `{# ... #}`."

<front>

What is the difference between using `{# ... #}` and `--` when commenting code in a dbt model?

<back>

`{# ... #}` are **Jinja comments**, which are stripped out by the compiler and **do not appear** in the final executable SQL. 

`--` are **SQL comments**, which pass through the compiler and **will appear** in the final SQL run against the data warehouse.
