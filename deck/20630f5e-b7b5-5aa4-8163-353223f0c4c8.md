  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The Reference Text discusses SQL comments using `--` and `/* */` in dbt models, but does not mention Jinja comments (`{# ... #}`), so there is insufficient information to verify the full difference stated in the Answer regarding both comment types and their behavior in the compiler."
  citation:
    quote: "Inline SQL comments will begin with two dashes (--) in front of them in a query or dbt model; any text following these dashes is therefore what you’d call 'commented out.'"

<front>

What is the difference between using `{# ... #}` and `--` when commenting code in a dbt model?

</front>

<back>

`{# ... #}` are **Jinja comments**, which are stripped out by the compiler and **do not appear** in the final executable SQL. 

`--` are **SQL comments**, which pass through the compiler and **will appear** in the final SQL run against the data warehouse.
