  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly supports the need for a hierarchical path under the `sources:` key in `dbt_project.yml` to configure a specific table within an imported package source, including subfolders (which correspond to package name in this context), source name, and table name."
  citation:
    quote: "To disable a source table nested in a YAML file in a subfolder, you will need to supply the subfolder(s) within the path to that YAML file, as well as the source name and the table name in the `dbt_project.yml` file."

<front>

What hierarchy path must be used in `dbt_project.yml` to configure a specific table within an imported package source?

You must use the fully qualified structure: `sources` > `package_name` > `source_name` > `table_name`. This ensures you are targeting the specific resource within the installed package namespace rather than a local source.
