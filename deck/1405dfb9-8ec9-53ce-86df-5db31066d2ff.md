<front>

What specific metadata field in a lineage node determines the SQL strategy dbt uses to build the object in the warehouse?

</front>

<back>

The `materializationType` field.

This metadata indicates whether the model is built as a `table`, `view`, `incremental`, or `ephemeral` object. It is derived from the model's `config()` block or `dbt_project.yml`.
