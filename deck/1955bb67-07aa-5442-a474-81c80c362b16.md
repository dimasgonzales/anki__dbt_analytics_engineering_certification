  explanation: "The reference text mentions a limitation related to relative paths in `packages.yml` and suggests using the Studio IDE as a workaround, implying potential issues in the CLI context. However, it does not explicitly state that the dbt Cloud CLI does not support relative paths, confirm that dbt Core supports them, or specify the need to replace with git repository references. Thus, there is insufficient information to fully support the answer."

<front>

What is the specific limitation of the dbt Cloud CLI regarding `packages.yml` configurations compared to dbt Core?

<back>

The dbt Cloud CLI does **not** support relative paths (e.g., `local: ../shared_project`) for package installations. While valid in dbt Core and the Cloud IDE, these must be replaced with git repository references when using the Cloud CLI.
