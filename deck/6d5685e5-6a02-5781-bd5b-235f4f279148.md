<front>

A complex incremental model is failing during execution, and you need to inspect the exact raw SQL query dbt is sending to the warehouse to identify the syntax error. How do you achieve this?

Run the specific model with the `--debug` flag:
```bash
dbt run --select my_model --debug
```
This increases logging verbosity to display the compiled SQL sent to the database.
