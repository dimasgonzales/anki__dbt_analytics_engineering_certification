<front>

You need to ensure that every `customer_id` in your `orders` model corresponds to an existing `id` in the `dim_customers` model. How would you configure this test?

</front>

<back>

Apply the `relationships` test to the `customer_id` column in the `orders` model configuration.

Example:
```yaml
columns:
  - name: customer_id
    tests:
      - relationships:
          to: ref('dim_customers')
          field: id
```

</back>
