  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer accurately describes the primary function of `dbt clone` as cloning nodes based on state to target schemas, creating clones or pointer views for fast environment duplication without physical data copying, which is explicitly supported by the reference text."
  citation:
    quote: "The `dbt clone` command clones selected nodes from the [specified state] to the target schema(s). This command makes use of the `clone` materialization: * If your data platform supports zero-copy cloning of tables (Snowflake, Databricks, or BigQuery), and this model exists as a table in the source environment, dbt will create it in your target environment as a clone. * Otherwise, dbt will create a simple pointer view (`select * from` the source object)"

What is the primary function of the `dbt clone` command?

<back>

The `dbt clone` command creates shallow copies (pointers) of nodes in a target schema based on the manifest provided via `--state`. This allows for fast environment duplication without physically copying data (on supported warehouses).
