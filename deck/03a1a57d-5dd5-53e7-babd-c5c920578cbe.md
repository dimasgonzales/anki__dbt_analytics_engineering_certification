What timezone does dbt Cloud use for all job schedules, and how does it handle Daylight Savings Time (DST)?

</front>

dbt Cloud uses **Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)** for all schedules.

It does **not** automatically adjust for Daylight Savings Time or local timezones. You must manually calculate the offset from UTC when configuring your cron schedules.
