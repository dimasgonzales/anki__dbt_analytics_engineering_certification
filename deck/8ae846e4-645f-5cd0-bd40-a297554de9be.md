<front>

What is the hierarchy of precedence for dbt model configurations from lowest to highest priority?

<back>

1. `dbt_project.yml` (Global/Project level)
2. YAML properties files (directory/file level)
3. In-file config block (Context level)

The more specific configuration always overrides the broader configuration.
