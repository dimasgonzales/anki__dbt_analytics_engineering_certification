  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text lists the configuration methods in order of precedence, with in-file config having highest priority, YAML files medium, and dbt_project.yml lowest, which matches the answer's hierarchy when interpreted from lowest to highest priority. The text also supports the principle that more specific configurations override broader ones."

What is the hierarchy of precedence for dbt model configurations from lowest to highest priority?

</front>

<back>

1. `dbt_project.yml` (Global/Project level)
2. YAML properties files (directory/file level)
3. In-file config block (Context level)

The more specific configuration always overrides the broader configuration.
