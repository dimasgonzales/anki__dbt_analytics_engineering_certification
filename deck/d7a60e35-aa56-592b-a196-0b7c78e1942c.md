The sources include content on YAML selectors and exposures, which are unrelated to the `target` variable.

<front>

What does the `target` variable represent, what attributes can you access on it, and how are those attributes populated?

<back>

`target` contains information about your connection to your data warehouse. How this information is populated differs by context:  

- In local development/the **dbt CLI**, values are based on the target defined in your profiles.yml file
- In the **dbt Cloud Scheduler**,  `target.name` is defined per-job, while all other attributes are defined by the deployment connection
- In the **dbt Cloud IDE**, values are defined by your connection and credentials

The adapter-agnostic values available on the object are:

- `profile_name`: the name of the active profile
- `name`: the name of the active target
- `schema`: the name of the dbt schema
- `type`: the active adapter being used (e.g. "postgres", "snowflake")
- `threads`: the number of threads in use by dbt

In addition, there are a number of adapter-specific values available (see link below for a full list)
