  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text confirms that top-level version numbers in .yml files are for parsing only, and model versioning for governance requires defining specific version configurations within model properties, such as a 'versions' list, which aligns with the answer."

<front>

You want to use dbt's Model Versioning feature to manage schema evolution for a `orders` model. You verify that `version: 2` is at the top of your `models.yml` file. Is this sufficient?

No. The top-level `version: 2` only handles file parsing.

To use **Model Versioning** (governance), you must define specific version configurations (like `latest_version` or a `versions` list) within the model properties, usually combined with contracts.
