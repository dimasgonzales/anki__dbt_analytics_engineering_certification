<front>

You are migrating a complex SQL transformation to a dbt Python model to utilize a specific data science library. You want the output to be a lightweight `view`. How should you proceed?

</front>

<back>

You must change your strategy, as dbt Python models cannot be materialized as views. You should materialize the Python model as a `table`. If a view is strictly required, separate the logic: output a table via Python, then create a SQL model materialized as a `view` that selects from that table.
