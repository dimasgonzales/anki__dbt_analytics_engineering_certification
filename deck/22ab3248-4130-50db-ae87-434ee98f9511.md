  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that using a `do` tag with `return` executes without generating an output string, which aligns with the answer's claim about preventing printing to the SQL buffer. It also confirms that `{{ return(...) }}` outputs a string, supporting the risk of unwanted output."

It ensures the value is returned programmatically without printing anything to the rendered SQL buffer. 

If you use `{{ return(...) }}`, it might attempt to print the return value to the template or leave unwanted whitespace before exiting.
