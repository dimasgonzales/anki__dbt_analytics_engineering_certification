  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer correctly identifies the field as 'analysis-paths' and accurately describes its purpose and default behavior as per the reference text, including that dbt will not compile analyses without this config and that dbt init sets it to 'analyses'."
  citation:
    quote: "Specify a custom list of directories where analyses are located. Without specifying this config, dbt will not compile any .sql files as analyses. However, the dbt init command populates this value as analyses."
