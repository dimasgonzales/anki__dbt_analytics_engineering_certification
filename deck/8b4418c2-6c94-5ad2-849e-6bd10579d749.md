<front>

When iterating through a list in Jinja to generate a comma-separated SQL list, what variable is used to prevent a trailing comma?

<back>

The `loop.last` variable.

This boolean variable is provided by the Jinja loop context. It returns `True` only during the final iteration of the loop. You typically check `{% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}` to ensure commas are placed between items but not after the final item.
