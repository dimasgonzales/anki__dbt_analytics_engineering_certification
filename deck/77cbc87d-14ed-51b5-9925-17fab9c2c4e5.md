<front>

You have a `customer_id` column that appears in 15 different models. How should you manage the description for this column to adhere to DRY principles and ensure consistency?

</front>

<back>

Define the description once in a Markdown file using a docs block, then reference that block in the `schema.yml` for every model containing that column.

**Markdown:**
```markdown
{% docs customer_id_def %} ... {% enddocs %}
```
**YAML:**
```yaml
description: "{{ doc('customer_id_def') }}"
```

</back>
