<front>

Given the following configuration in `dbt_project.yml`, what schema will a seed located in the `models/marketing/` folder use?

```yaml
seeds:
  my_project:
    +schema: general_data
    marketing:
      +schema: marketing_data
```

</front>

<back>

It will use `marketing_data`. dbt uses hierarchical scoping where more specific configurations override broader ones. Since the `marketing` subdirectory config is more specific than the project-level config, it takes precedence.
