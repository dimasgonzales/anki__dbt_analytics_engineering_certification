What is one advantage of using `dbt build` vs. using multiple separate commands (e.g. `dbt run` + `dbt test`) during deployment?

`dbt build` will run everything (including models *and* tests) in DAG order, with each step executing as soon as possible after the steps it depends on. This minimizes wasting compute resources doing, say, an extensive `dbt run` execution followed by a quickly-failing `dbt test`. `dbt build` will run the tests for a source, model, etc., as early as possible, so unrecoverable failures will be able to prevent unnecessary downstream processing as soon as possible. These benefits are increased by adding the `--fail-fast` option, which causes the entire build process to halt as soon as literally anything fails (in-progress concurrent processing will be interrupted/stopped).
