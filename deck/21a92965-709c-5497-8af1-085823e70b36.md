  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer correctly describes that dbt build runs in DAG order and early test failures prevent downstream processing to minimize wasted compute resources, which is explicitly supported by the reference text. The mention of --fail-fast is not addressed in the text but does not contradict the core advantage."

<front>

What is one advantage of using `dbt build` vs. using multiple separate commands (e.g. `dbt run` + `dbt test`) during deployment?

`dbt build` will run everything (including models *and* tests) in DAG order, with each step executing as soon as possible after the steps it depends on. This minimizes wasting compute resources doing, say, an extensive `dbt run` execution followed by a quickly-failing `dbt test`. `dbt build` will run the tests for a source, model, etc., as early as possible, so unrecoverable failures will be able to prevent unnecessary downstream processing as soon as possible. These benefits are increased by adding the `--fail-fast` option, which causes the entire build process to halt as soon as literally anything fails (in-progress concurrent processing will be interrupted/stopped).
