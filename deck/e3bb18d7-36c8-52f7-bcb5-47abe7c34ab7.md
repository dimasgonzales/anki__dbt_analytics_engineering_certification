  verdict: CONTRADICTED
  explanation: "The answer is contradicted by the reference text, which explicitly defines state:old as selecting nodes modified since the last run, whereas the answer claims it selects methods existing in the state manifest to target resources with historical state."

What is the specific function of the `state:old` selector method in dbt?

<back>

`state:old` selects methods that exist in the state manifest (the comparison artifact, usually representing production). It is used to filter selections to ensure you are only targeting resources that have a historical state available.
