<front>

How can you select dbt resources based specifically on their materialization strategy (e.g., incremental vs. table) using the CLI?

<back>

You can use the `config` selector key followed by dot notation for the specific property.

Command:
```bash
dbt run --select config.materialized:incremental
```
This runs all models where the materialization config is set to `incremental`.
