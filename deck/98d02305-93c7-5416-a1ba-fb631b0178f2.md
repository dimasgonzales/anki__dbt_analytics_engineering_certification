<front>

You modified a core staging model, `stg_users`. You want to verify that the models immediately relying on it still build correctly, but you do not want to run the entire downstream graph. What command should you use?

</front>

<back>

You should run:

```bash
dbt build --select stg_users+1
```

This selects `stg_users` and its **1st-degree children** only, ignoring deeper descendants.
