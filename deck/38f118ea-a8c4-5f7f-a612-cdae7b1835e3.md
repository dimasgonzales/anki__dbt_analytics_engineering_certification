  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly mentions that the `--state` flag is used to pass paths to manifests from prior invocations for state selection and deferral, which aligns with the answer's description of providing a file path to artifacts like manifest.json for comparisons."
  citation:
    quote: "It is possible to use separate state for `state:modified` and `--defer`, by passing paths to different manifests to each of the `--state`/`DBT_STATE` and `--defer-state`/`DBT_DEFER_STATE`."

<back>

The `--state` flag provides the file path to a directory containing artifacts (specifically `manifest.json`) from a prior invocation. This file is required for dbt to perform comparisons for state selection and deferral.
