<front>

You are processing high-volume, immutable event logs in BigQuery partitioned by `event_date`. You need to efficiently reprocess historical data for specific days without scanning the entire table or paying for row-level merges. Which strategy is best?

<back>

Use `insert_overwrite`.
This strategy is the most cost-effective and performant for this scenario in BigQuery because it replaces the specific date partitions atomically without the overhead of checking row-level uniqueness.
```yaml
{{ config(
  materialized='incremental',
  partition_by={'field': 'event_date', 'data_type': 'date'},
  incremental_strategy='insert_overwrite'
) }}
```
