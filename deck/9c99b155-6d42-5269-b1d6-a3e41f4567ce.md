What are singular tests in dbt?

</front>

<back>

**Singular tests** are usually one-off assertions written to test a single, specific model. These tests are SQL queries that will return failing records (i.e. the query should be written such that it should return no results if the test "passes"). By default, these tests are expected to live in the `tests` directory, but this can be changed via the `test-paths` config option.
