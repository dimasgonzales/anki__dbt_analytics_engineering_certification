<front>

A complex model containing Jinja logic is failing with a database syntax error. You want to inspect the exact SQL query being sent to the data warehouse without trying to run it again. How should you proceed?

<back>

Run `dbt compile` targeting that specific model, then open the generated file to inspect the raw SQL:

```bash
dbt compile --select my_model
# Open target/compiled/my_project/models/my_model.sql
```

</back>
