  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Answer is explicitly supported by the Reference Text, which states that the .dbtignore file specifies files to be ignored by dbt, behaves like .gitignore, and files matching patterns are not read, parsed, or detected."
  citation:
    quote: "You can create a .dbtignore file in the root of your dbt project to specify files that should be entirely ignored by dbt. The file behaves like a .gitignore file, using the same syntax. Files and subdirectories matching the pattern will not be read, parsed, or otherwise detected by dbt—as if they didn't exist."

<front>

What is the purpose of the `.dbtignore` file in a dbt project?

<back>

The `.dbtignore` file tells dbt to completely ignore specified file patterns or directories. Files matching these patterns are not read, parsed, or detected by dbt, functioning identically to `.gitignore`.
