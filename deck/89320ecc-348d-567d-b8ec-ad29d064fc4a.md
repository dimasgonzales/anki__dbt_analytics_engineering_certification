  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that records with 'dbt_valid_to = null' are current or still valid in dbt snapshot tables, which directly supports the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "All records will have a `dbt_valid_to = null` or the value specified in [`dbt_valid_to_current`] (available in dbt Core 1.9+) if configured."

<front>

What does a `NULL` value in the `dbt_valid_to` column of a snapshot table indicate?

<back>

It indicates that the record is the current (active) version of that row. The `dbt_valid_to` column tracks the timestamp when a row version became invalid; if it is null, the row is still valid.
