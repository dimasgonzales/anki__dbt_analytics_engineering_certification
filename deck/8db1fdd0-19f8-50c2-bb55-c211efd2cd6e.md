<front>

You need to ensure that `bi_tool_user` has `select` access to a specific model directly within that model's SQL file. How do you configure this?

</front>

<back>

Use the `config()` block inside the model file. 
```sql
{{ config(
  grants = {'select': ['bi_tool_user']}
) }}
```
dbt will automatically apply these permissions when the model runs.
