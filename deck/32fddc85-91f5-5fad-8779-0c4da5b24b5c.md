<front>

Your team uses the 'Compatible' release track. You need to verify if your project code works with the 'Latest' version before upgrading the shared environment.

How would you accomplish this without affecting the Production pipeline?

<back>

Configure a **User Development Override** in your Account Settings > Credentials. 

1. Select the project.
2. Change the 'dbt version' to the target upgrade version.
3. Run `dbt build` in the IDE to verify compatibility.

This isolates the version change to your user profile only.
