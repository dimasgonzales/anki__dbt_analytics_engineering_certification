  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explains that configurations are applied hierarchically, with more specific scopes overriding less specific ones. This directly supports the answer that model-level configurations in the config() block take precedence over those in dbt_project.yml."

<back>

Configurations defined in the in-file `config()` block take precedence over settings in `dbt_project.yml`.

Specific model configs always override project-level or folder-level defaults.
