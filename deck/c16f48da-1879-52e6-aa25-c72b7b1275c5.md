What is the difference in the versioning schema format between dbt Core and dbt Cloud Release Tracks?

</front>

<back>

dbt Core follows **Semantic Versioning** (Major.Minor.Patch, e.g., `1.7.6`), whereas dbt Cloud Release Tracks use a **date-based format** (YYYY.M.D+suffix, e.g., `2024.10.8+...`) to reflect continuous updates.
