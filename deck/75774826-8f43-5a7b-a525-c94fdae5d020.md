  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text only provides evidence for dbt Explorer's features, such as integrating execution metadata and displaying real-time freshness info, but does not mention static documentation from 'dbt docs generate' or make a direct comparison between the two, so the entire answer cannot be fully verified."
  citation:
    quote: "dbt Explorer marries the execution metadata to the documentation experience — it reflects the latest state of your project across all your job runs in your production environment, and embeds the execution information throughout the product."

<front>

What is the primary difference between the static documentation generated by `dbt docs generate` and dbt Explorer regarding data freshness?

<back>

Static documentation is a snapshot in time representing the project structure when generated. **dbt Explorer** provides stateful awareness, integrating **execution metadata** from the Production environment to display the real-time pass/fail status of models and source freshness alongside documentation.
