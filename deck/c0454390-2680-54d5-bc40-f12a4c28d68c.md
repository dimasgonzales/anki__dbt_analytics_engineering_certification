<front>

You are running tests on a Materialized View that updates continuously. You notice tests failing intermittently, but by the time you query the model, the data has changed. How do you troubleshoot this?

</front>

<back>

Configure your tests to store failures as views rather than ephemeral results.

Add `+store_failures_as: view` to your `dbt_project.yml` or model config. This persists the specific rows that caused the failure, preserving the state at the exact moment the test ran.
