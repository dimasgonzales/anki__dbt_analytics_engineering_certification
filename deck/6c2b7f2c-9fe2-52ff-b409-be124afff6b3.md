<front>

You attempt to run `dbt build` in the dbt Cloud CLI but receive a 'Session occupied' error. How do you troubleshoot and resolve this?

</front>

<back>

The Cloud CLI enforces a single-writer session. To resolve a stuck session:
1. List active sessions: ```dbt invocation list```
2. Cancel the blocking process: ```dbt invocation cancel <invocation_id>```
This clears the lock on the remote infrastructure.
