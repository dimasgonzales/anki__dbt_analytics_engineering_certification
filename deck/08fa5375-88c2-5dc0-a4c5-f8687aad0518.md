  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that sequences increment on every query, and using them as surrogate keys for views causes the IDs to change each time the view is accessed, which aligns with the answer's reasoning about breaking referential integrity."
  citation:
    quote: "* **Views -** Because sequences in Snowflake increment on every query, using them as the surrogate keys for views would mean every time the view is queried, the sequence would increment and therefore change. This strategy would only work for table or incremental models."

<front>

Why are database sequences (integer incrementing keys) generally discouraged for dbt models configured as `views`?

<back>

Database sequences are stateful and increment every time a value is requested. Since a view runs its query every time it is accessed, the IDs would change on every select statement, breaking referential integrity and joining logic.
