<front>

What environment variable prefix must be used to inject custom metadata into the `info.extra` field of dbt logs?

<back>

The prefix `DBT_ENV_CUSTOM_ENV_`.

Any environment variable starting with this prefix will be parsed, and the suffix will be added as a key in the log's `info.extra` object.
