  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text confirms that the `target` variable is used for defining the data warehouse connection, which aligns with the Answer's claim about containing connection configuration context. It also references `target.name` in the context of environment-specific setups, supporting the use for applying environment-specific logic."

<back>

The `target` variable contains context about the current connection configuration (defined in `profiles.yml`). It is commonly used with `target.name` to apply environment-specific logic, such as limiting data volume in development vs. production.
