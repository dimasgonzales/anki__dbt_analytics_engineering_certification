  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly indicates that for cloud data warehouses like Snowflake and BigQuery, the not_null constraint is enforced, while primary_key, foreign_key, and unique constraints are not enforced and are metadata-only, which directly supports the flashcard answer."

<front>

When using model contracts on cloud data warehouses like Snowflake or BigQuery, which constraint is physically enforced versus which are typically metadata-only?

<back>

The `not_null` constraint is physically enforced; the database will reject records with null values, failing the build. Constraints like `primary_key`, `foreign_key`, and `unique` are generally **metadata-only** on these platforms and do not prevent data violation during insertion.
