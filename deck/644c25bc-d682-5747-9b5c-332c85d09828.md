<front>

You need to ensure your team knows who to contact if the 'Executive Sales Dashboard' breaks due to a model change. How would you configure this in dbt?

<back>

Define an `exposure` in your `.yml` files that represents the dashboard. Include the `owner` property with `name` and `email` fields. 

Example:
```yaml
exposures:
  - name: executive_sales_dashboard
    type: dashboard
    owner:
      name: Data Team
      email: data@company.com
```
