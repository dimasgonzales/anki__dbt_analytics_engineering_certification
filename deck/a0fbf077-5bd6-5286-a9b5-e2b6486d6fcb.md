  explanation: "The reference text does not contain information about a field named 'compiled_code' in 'run_results.json'. It mentions other attributes like 'adapter_response' and 'compiled', but there is no evidence to support or contradict that 'compiled_code' is the field showing the exact SQL query executed."

In `run_results.json`, which field allows you to see the exact SQL query that dbt executed against the data warehouse?

<back>

`compiled_code`.

This field contains the fully rendered SQL (after Jinja processing). It is paired with `adapter_response`, which provides metadata from the warehouse execution (like row counts).
