  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that the 'compiled_code' field in run_results.json contains the rendered SQL query, which directly supports the answer that compiled_code allows seeing the exact SQL query executed."

<front>

In `run_results.json`, which field allows you to see the exact SQL query that dbt executed against the data warehouse?

<back>

`compiled_code`.

This field contains the fully rendered SQL (after Jinja processing). It is paired with `adapter_response`, which provides metadata from the warehouse execution (like row counts).
