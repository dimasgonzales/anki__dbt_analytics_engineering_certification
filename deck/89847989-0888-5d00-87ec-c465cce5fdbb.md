  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Answer accurately describes the state selectors for new and modified nodes, and the method of comparing manifest files, which is explicitly supported by the reference text. However, the environment variable DBT_ARTIFACT_STATE_PATH and sub-selectors for state:modified are not mentioned in the provided text."

How can you select nodes that are new and/or modified compared to a previous version of the same project?

`--select state:new` selects completely new nodes.  
`--select state:modified` selects new *and* modified nodes.  
  
New/modified nodes are identified by comparing manifest files between the current and old version of the project. The file path of the old manifest file *must* be specified either using the `--state` flag or by setting the DBT\_ARTIFACT\_STATE\_PATH environment variable.  
  
Note that `state:modified` also supports various sub-selectors (e.g. "state:modified.configs") that allow you to select nodes where only certain parts/aspects of the node were modified. For a full list see the link below.
