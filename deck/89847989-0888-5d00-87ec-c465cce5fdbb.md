  explanation: "The Reference Text does not mention the 'state:new' selector, which is a key part of the Answer. It only discusses 'state:modified' for identifying new and modified nodes, leaving insufficient information to verify the entire Answer."

How can you select nodes that are new and/or modified compared to a previous version of the same project?

`--select state:new` selects completely new nodes.  
`--select state:modified` selects new *and* modified nodes.  
  
New/modified nodes are identified by comparing manifest files between the current and old version of the project. The file path of the old manifest file *must* be specified either using the `--state` flag or by setting the DBT\_ARTIFACT\_STATE\_PATH environment variable.  
  
Note that `state:modified` also supports various sub-selectors (e.g. "state:modified.configs") that allow you to select nodes where only certain parts/aspects of the node were modified. For a full list see the link below.
