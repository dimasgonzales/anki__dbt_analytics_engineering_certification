<front>

You are maintaining a core model `dim_users` referenced by other teams. How do you prevent breaking downstream dependencies when changing data types?

<back>

You should define a **Model Contract** for `dim_users`. By specifying the column names and data types in YAML and setting `contract: { enforced: true }`, dbt will fail the build if your SQL logic produces a result set that violates the contract.

```yaml
config:
  contract: { enforced: true }
```
