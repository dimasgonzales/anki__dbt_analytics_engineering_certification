<front>

You are referencing `{{ ref('finance', 'revenue') }}` but dbt fails with an error saying the model cannot be found or access is denied. What configuration is likely missing in the upstream project?

<back>

The upstream model `revenue` in the `finance` project likely lacks the `access: public` configuration. By default, models are not exposed to other projects.

Correct config:
```yaml
models:
  - name: revenue
    access: public
```

</back>
