<front>

You have created a generic test `{% test valid_email(...) %}` and documented it as follows:

```yaml
macros:
  - name: valid_email
    description: "Checks for valid email format"
```

However, the description is not appearing in the generated docs. What is the error?

<back>

The macro name in the documentation block is incorrect. dbt internally prefixes generic tests with `test_`.

You must change the name in the YAML to `test_valid_email` to correctly map the description to the test macro.
