<front>

You have a legacy table with duplicate records from 2019 that cause a `unique` test to fail. You only care about uniqueness for data entering the system today. How would you solve this?

</front>

<back>

Add a `where` clause to the test configuration to exclude the legacy data.

```yaml
columns:
  - name: id
    data_tests:
      - unique:
          config:
             where: "order_date >= current_date"
```

</back>
