<front>

You have a 5GB raw transaction file and a small CSV mapping product categories. How should you bring these into your dbt project?

</front>

<back>

1. **Raw Transactions**: Load via an external ETL tool and define it as a **Source** in dbt (seeds are not for large data).
2. **Category Mapping**: Save as a CSV in the `seeds` folder and run `dbt seed`.

Seeds are version-controlled and meant for static, small datasets.
