  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that in the dbt_project.yml context, the var() function can only access variables defined with the command-line --vars argument, which directly supports the answer that variables must be passed via the command line and not from the vars: block in the file."

<front>

When using the `var()` function inside a resource configuration block in `dbt_project.yml`, where must the variable be defined to be successfully resolved?

<back>

The variable must be passed via the **command line** (using `--vars`). The `var()` function in this specific context cannot access variables defined in the `vars:` block of the `dbt_project.yml` file itself due to parsing order.
