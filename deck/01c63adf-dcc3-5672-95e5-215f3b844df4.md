What is the order of precedence for dbt configurations from highest priority to lowest priority?

<back>

dbt resolves configuration conflicts in this order:
1. In-file `{{ config() }}` Jinja macro (Highest)
2. `config` property in a `.yml` file
3. `dbt_project.yml` file (Lowest)

Additionally, configurations in the root project always override those in installed packages.
