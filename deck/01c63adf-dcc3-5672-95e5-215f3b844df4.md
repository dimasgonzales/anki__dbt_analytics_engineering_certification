  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly lists the order of precedence for dbt configurations as: 1. Using a config() Jinja macro within a model, 2. Config in a .yml file, 3. From dbt_project.yml, which exactly matches the answer. It also confirms that root project configurations have higher precedence than those in installed packages, supporting the additional note."

<front>

What is the order of precedence for dbt configurations from highest priority to lowest priority?

<back>

dbt resolves configuration conflicts in this order:
1. In-file `{{ config() }}` Jinja macro (Highest)
2. `config` property in a `.yml` file
3. `dbt_project.yml` file (Lowest)

Additionally, configurations in the root project always override those in installed packages.
