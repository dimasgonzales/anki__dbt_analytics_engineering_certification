<front>

Is it safe to run multiple dbt commands (like `dbt run`) concurrently within a single Python process using threading?

No. dbt Core is **not thread-safe** for multiple invocations within the same process due to global variable interactions. Doing so can cause unpredictable behavior or platform interactions. You must use separate processes.
