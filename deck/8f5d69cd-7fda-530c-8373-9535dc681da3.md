  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly confirms that dbt-core does not support safe parallel execution for multiple invocations in the same process, citing global variable interactions and the need for separate processes, which directly aligns with the Answer's assertion that it is not safe and requires separate processes."

<front>

Is it safe to run multiple dbt commands (like `dbt run`) concurrently within a single Python process using threading?

No. dbt Core is **not thread-safe** for multiple invocations within the same process due to global variable interactions. Doing so can cause unpredictable behavior or platform interactions. You must use separate processes.
