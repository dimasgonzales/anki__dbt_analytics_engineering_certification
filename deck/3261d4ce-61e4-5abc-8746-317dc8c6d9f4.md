  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that for unversioned models with contracts, dbt warns about breaking changes, and for versioned models, it raises an error, which matches the answer's distinction between warnings and errors."
  citation:
    quote: "dbt also warns if a model has or had a contract but isn't versioned. dbt will detect changes to versioned model contracts, and raise an error if any of those changes could be breaking."

<front>

What is the difference in behavior for breaking changes in an enforced contract between a **versioned** model and a **non-versioned** model?

<back>

For a **non-versioned** model, breaking changes raise a **WARNING**.

For a **versioned** model, breaking changes raise an **ERROR** and fail the build.
