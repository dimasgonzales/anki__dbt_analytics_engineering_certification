<front>

A `source freshness` check on a massive event logs table is timing out because it is performing a full table scan. How would you resolve this without removing the check?

<back>

Add a `filter` configuration to the table's freshness block to limit the query to recent data.

Example:
```yaml
freshness:
  warn_after: {count: 6, period: hour}
  filter: "_etl_loaded_at > current_date - 1"
```

</back>
