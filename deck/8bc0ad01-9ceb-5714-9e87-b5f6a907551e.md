dbt models are strictly declarative `SELECT` statements. `INSERT` and `UPDATE` operations are handled automatically by dbt's materialization configurations (e.g., `table`, `incremental`). Logic requiring a `DELETE` command in a procedural script must be converted into a `WHERE` clause in dbt to filter out unwanted records.
