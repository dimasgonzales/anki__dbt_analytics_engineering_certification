What is the difference between the contents of the `target/compiled` and `target/run` directories in dbt?

<back>

`target/compiled` contains the raw `SELECT` statements generated by dbt. `target/run` contains the full DDL/DML (e.g., `CREATE TABLE`, `MERGE`) that is actually executed against the database. You typically use `target/run` to debug execution errors.
