You have a long model description that you want to split across several lines in your `schema.yml` file for readability, but you want it to render as a single sentence in the documentation site. Which YAML syntax should you use?

<back>

Use the **folded style** (`>`).

Example:
```yaml
description: >
  This text will appear as one line
  in the dbt documentation.
```
