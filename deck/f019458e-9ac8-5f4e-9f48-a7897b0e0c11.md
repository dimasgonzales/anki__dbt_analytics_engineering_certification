  verdict: CONTRADICTED
  explanation: "The answer claims that 'version' is a required top-level key, but the reference text explicitly states that in dbt Core v1.5, the 'version' key is optional in dbt_project.yml, contradicting the requirement."
  citation:

    quote: "Also starting in v1.5, both the [`config-version: 2`](/reference/project-configs/config-version) and the top-level `version:` key in the `dbt_project.yml` are optional."

A valid `dbt_project.yml` must include:
1. `name`: The project name (snake_case)
2. `version`: The version of the project
3. `profile`: The name of the connection profile used in `profiles.yml`
