  explanation: "The reference text mentions using the '--select' flag with 'state:modified+' for Slim CI but does not explicitly state the requirement for the '--state' flag to specify production artifacts. Additionally, the text uses 'state:modified+' (including children) while the answer uses 'state:modified', and it does not provide sufficient information to confirm the exact CLI flags required."

<front>

What two CLI flags are required to run a 'Slim CI' build that processes only modified resources based on a comparison to production?

You need the `--select` flag with the `state:modified` selector, and the `--state` flag pointing to the directory containing the production artifacts (specifically `manifest.json`).

```bash
dbt build --select state:modified --state path/to/artifacts
```
