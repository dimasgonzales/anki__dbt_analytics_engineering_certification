  verdict: CONTRADICTED
  explanation: "The answer specifies only the `--select` flag with `state:modified` and the `--state` flag as required for a Slim CI build. However, the reference text indicates that Slim CI is enabled by both the state selection method and deferral, with deferral requiring the `--defer` flag in addition to `--state` for full functionality. This suggests that the answer may be incomplete or that more flags are involved for a complete Slim CI setup, contradicting the claim that only two flags are required."

<front>

What two CLI flags are required to run a 'Slim CI' build that processes only modified resources based on a comparison to production?

You need the `--select` flag with the `state:modified` selector, and the `--state` flag pointing to the directory containing the production artifacts (specifically `manifest.json`).

```bash
dbt build --select state:modified --state path/to/artifacts
```
