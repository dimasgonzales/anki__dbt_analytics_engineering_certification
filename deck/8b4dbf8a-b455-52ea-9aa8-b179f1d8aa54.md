<front>

A developer successfully runs `dbt build` in production, but the dbt Cloud documentation site still shows old column types and missing models. What is the likely cause?

<back>

The production job likely skipped the `dbt docs generate` step.

The documentation site is a static artifact generated based on the metadata at the time the `docs generate` command was last run. It does not automatically update just because the tables in the warehouse were rebuilt.
