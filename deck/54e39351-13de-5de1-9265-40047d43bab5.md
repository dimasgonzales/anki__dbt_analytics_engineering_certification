  explanation: "The reference text mentions auditing dbt models against legacy SQL, which is related to side-by-side comparison, but it does not explicitly describe the 'Alongside' refactoring strategy, its name, or specific steps such as creating models in a separate directory while keeping legacy processes running. Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the answer."

<front>

What is the 'Alongside' refactoring strategy?

</front>

---

<back>

The 'Alongside' strategy involves creating new dbt models in a separate directory (e.g., `models/marts`) while keeping the legacy SQL processes running.

This allows for side-by-side auditing and ensures the new models are correct before deprecating the old ones.
