Which two configuration properties are required to enable source freshness checks in dbt?

You must define a `loaded_at_field` (a timestamp column in the source table) and a `freshness` block containing `warn_after` and/or `error_after` thresholds.
```yaml
config:
  loaded_at_field: updated_at
  freshness:
    warn_after: {count: 6, period: hour}
```

</back>
