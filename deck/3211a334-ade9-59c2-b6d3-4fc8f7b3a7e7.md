<front>

You are investigating a "stale data" report for the Executive Dashboard exposure. You see that the immediate parent models ran successfully. What is the next logical step to troubleshoot using dbt?

<back>

Check the **Source Freshness** of the upstream sources linked to that exposure. If the raw data hasn't loaded recently, the models will run successfully but process old data.

Command to check:
```bash
dbt source freshness --select +exposure:executive_dashboard
```

</back>
