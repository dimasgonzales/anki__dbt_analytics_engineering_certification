  explanation: "The Reference Text contains an example showing the model function defined with 'dbt' and 'session' arguments, aligning with part of the answer, but it does not explicitly state that a DataFrame is the mandatory return value or confirm the requirements definitively, so there is insufficient information to fully verify the entire answer."

<front>

What are the two required arguments for the `model` function in a dbt Python model, and what is the mandatory return value?

</front>

---

<back>

The function must accept `dbt` and `session` as arguments and must return a **DataFrame**.

Example:
```python
def model(dbt, session):
    # logic here
    return df
```

</back>
