<front>

You need to run `ANALYZE TABLE` or `VACUUM` immediately after a specific model finishes building to update query statistics. How should you implement this in dbt?

<back>

Define a `post-hook` within the model's configuration block. This ensures the maintenance command runs as part of the model's transaction or immediately following it.

```sql
{{ config(
  post_hook="ANALYZE TABLE {{ this }} COMPUTE STATISTICS"
) }}
```

</back>
