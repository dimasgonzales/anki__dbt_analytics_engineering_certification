  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly states that the Model timing tab in dbt Cloud displays the composition, order, and time of models in a job run, highlighting the top 1% of model durations to help identify bottlenecks, which directly supports the Answer's claim."
  citation:
    quote: "The **Model timing** tab displays the composition, order, and time each model takes in a job run. The visualization appears for successful jobs and highlights the top 1% of model durations. This helps you identify bottlenecks in your runs so you can investigate them and potentially make changes to improve their performance."

What specific visualization in dbt Cloud allows you to analyze model duration and execution order to identify bottlenecks in a job?

The **Model Timing** tab. It displays a Gantt-style view of the job's execution, specifically highlighting the top 1% of longest-running models. This allows engineers to visually identify slow steps and opportunities for parallelization in the DAG.
