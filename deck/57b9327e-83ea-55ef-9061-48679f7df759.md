<front>

You are writing a Python orchestration script and need to trigger a dbt build for specific tags. How would you implement this using `dbtRunner`?

<back>

Instantiate `dbtRunner` and call `.invoke()` with the command and selection arguments. You can pass arguments as a list or as keywords.

```python
dbt = dbtRunner()
res = dbt.invoke(["build", "--select", "tag:daily"])
```
