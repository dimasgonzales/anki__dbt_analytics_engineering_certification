<front>

You have a top-level column list for `dim_customers`. For version 2, you want to inherit all columns except `is_active`, which is deprecated. 

How do you configure the YAML for version 2?

<back>

Use `include: "*"` combined with the `exclude` list.

```yaml
versions:
  - v: 2
    columns:
      - include: "*"
        exclude: ["is_active"]
```

</back>
