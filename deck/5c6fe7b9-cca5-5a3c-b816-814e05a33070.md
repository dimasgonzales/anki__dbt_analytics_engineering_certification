You are troubleshooting a production error using the Metadata API, but the returned lineage shows the model materialization as 'view' when you know it runs as a 'table' in production. What is the likely cause?

You must verify that the `environment(id: ...)` in your GraphQL query matches the ID of your Production job to see the correct materialization config.
