  explanation: "The Reference Text states that `on_configuration_change` configures dbt to make configuration changes directly to objects, but it does not explicitly mention 'drift' detection or the specific values 'apply' and 'continue' as described in the answer."

What is the purpose of the `on_configuration_change` setting for advanced materializations like materialized views?

<back>

It determines how dbt responds when it detects 'drift' between the configured model and the existing database object.

For example, it can be set to `apply` (attempt an atomic update/ALTER) or `continue` (log a warning but do not touch the object).
