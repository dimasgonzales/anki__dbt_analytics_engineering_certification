  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly describes the `on_configuration_change` setting as determining how dbt handles configuration changes (referred to as 'drift' in the answer), with `apply` attempting updates and `continue` providing warnings without changes, which directly supports the answer's purpose and examples."
  citation:
    evidence_source: "https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/on_configuration_change"
    quote: "The `on_configuration_change` config has three settings: * `apply` (default) — Attempt to update the existing database object if possible, avoiding a complete rebuild. * `continue` — Allow runs to continue while also providing a warning that the object was left untouched."

What is the purpose of the `on_configuration_change` setting for advanced materializations like materialized views?

<back>

It determines how dbt responds when it detects 'drift' between the configured model and the existing database object.

For example, it can be set to `apply` (attempt an atomic update/ALTER) or `continue` (log a warning but do not touch the object).
