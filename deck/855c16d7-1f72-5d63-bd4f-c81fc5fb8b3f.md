<front>

Why is the `{% if execute %}` check necessary when using `run_query` in a dbt model?

</front>

<back>

To handle the parsing phase where queries are not actually run.

dbt parses models to build the DAG before executing SQL. During parsing, `execute` is `False`, and `run_query` returns no data (None). Accessing properties of the result (like `.columns`) without this check causes compilation errors.
