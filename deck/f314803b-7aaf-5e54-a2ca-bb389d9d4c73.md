<front>

Your team wants to optimize development speed by materializing all models in the `marts` directory as views in the 'dev' environment, but as tables in 'prod'. How would you configure this in `dbt_project.yml`?

Navigate to the `models` block, locate the `marts` folder, and set the `+materialized` config using a conditional based on `target.name`:

```yaml
models:
  my_project:
    marts:
      +materialized: "{{ 'view' if target.name == 'dev' else 'table' }}"
```

</back>
