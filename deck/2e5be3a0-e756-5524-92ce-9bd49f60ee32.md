<front>

You have set the 'Custom Branch' configuration to `qa-release` in a Deployment environment. What happens when a job runs in this environment?

</front>

<back>

The job runner will execute a git clone specifically for that branch before running dbt commands. Effectively:

```bash
git clone -b qa-release
```

It will ignore the repository's default branch (e.g., `main`) for this run.
