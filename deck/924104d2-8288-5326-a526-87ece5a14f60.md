  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The Reference Text mentions the concept of using the `state` selector to compare the current project against a state manifest for running modified models, as seen in the discussion of 'slim CI'. However, it does not explicitly specify the exact selector method `state:modified`, and no direct quote supports or contradicts this specific term."

<front>

Which selector method allows dbt to identify and run only the resources that have been added or updated compared to a reference manifest?

The `state:modified` selector.

Example usage:
```bash
dbt run --select state:modified --state path/to/artifacts
```
This requires comparing the current project against a generic artifact (manifest.json) from a previous run.
