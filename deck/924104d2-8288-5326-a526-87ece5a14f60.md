<front>

Which selector method allows dbt to identify and run only the resources that have been added or updated compared to a reference manifest?

The `state:modified` selector.

Example usage:
```bash
dbt run --select state:modified --state path/to/artifacts
```
This requires comparing the current project against a generic artifact (manifest.json) from a previous run.
