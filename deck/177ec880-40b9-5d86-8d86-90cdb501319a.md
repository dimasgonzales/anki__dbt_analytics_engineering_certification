Which specific `type` value must be assigned to an exposure to enable the 'Embed data health tile' feature in the dbt Cloud UI?

</front>

<back>

The exposure must be defined with **`type: dashboard`**.

```yaml
exposures:
  - name: executive_dash
    type: dashboard # Required for embed tiles
```
Other types like `notebook` or `analysis` do not support the embed feature.
