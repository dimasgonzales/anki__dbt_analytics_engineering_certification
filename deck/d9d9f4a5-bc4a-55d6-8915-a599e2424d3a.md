  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text confirms that to enable a model contract, you must set 'enforced: true' under the 'contract' key, and it requires defining 'name' and 'data_type' for all columns, as evidenced by the preflight check and YAML examples."

    quote: "When building a model with a defined contract, dbt will run a \"preflight\" check to ensure that the model's query will return a set of columns with names and data types matching the ones you have defined."

How do you enable a model contract in dbt, and what specific requirement does this place on your column definitions?

<back>

To enable a contract, you must set `enforced: true` under the `contract` key in the model configuration. This requires that you explicitly define the `name` and `data_type` for **every** column returned by the SQL query in your YAML file.
