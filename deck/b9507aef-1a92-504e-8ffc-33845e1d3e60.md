  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly defines the 'profile' field in dbt_project.yml and confirms that it is not applicable (implying optional) in dbt Cloud but required locally unless overridden by the --profile flag, which aligns with the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "Definition: The profile your dbt project should use to connect to your data warehouse... If you are developing in dbt: This configuration is not applicable. If you are developing locally: This configuration is required, unless a command-line option like `--profile` is supplied."

What **dbt\_project.yml** field is used to specify what profile your dbt project should use to connect to your data warehouse? When is this option required?

**profile**. This configuration is optional when developing in dbt Cloud, but required when developing locally (unless you pass the `--profile` flag through the CLI instead)
