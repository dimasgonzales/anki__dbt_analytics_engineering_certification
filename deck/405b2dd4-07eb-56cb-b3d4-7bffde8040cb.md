When defining configurations under a specific folder structure in `dbt_project.yml`, what syntax must be used to distinguish configs from directory names?

You must use the `+` prefix for configuration keys.

Example:
```yaml
+materialized: view
+tags: ['marketing']
```
This tells dbt that the key is a configuration setting applied to the current path, not a subdirectory name.
