  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that in dbt_project.yml, the '+' prefix is used to distinguish configuration keys from directory names when defining configurations under a specific folder structure."
  citation:
    quote: "We demarcate between a folder name and a configuration by using a `+`, so `marketing`, `paid_ads`, and `google` below are folder names, whereas **`+materialized` is a configuration** being applied to those folder and all folders nested below them."

When defining configurations under a specific folder structure in `dbt_project.yml`, what syntax must be used to distinguish configs from directory names?

You must use the `+` prefix for configuration keys.

Example:
```yaml
+materialized: view
+tags: ['marketing']
```
This tells dbt that the key is a configuration setting applied to the current path, not a subdirectory name.
