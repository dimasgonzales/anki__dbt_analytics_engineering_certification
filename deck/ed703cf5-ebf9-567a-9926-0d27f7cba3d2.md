<front>

You run a relationship test on a modified model while using `--defer` to reference upstream production tables. Why might this test behave unexpectedly?

</front>

<back>

The test executes 'across' environments, joining your **development** model (child) with the **production** model (parent). 

This can cause false failures if the production data is stale or if your development model contains new keys that haven't yet arrived in the production parent table.
