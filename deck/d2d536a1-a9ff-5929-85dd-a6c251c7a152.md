<front>

How does dbt handle differences in data type names (e.g., `VARCHAR` vs `STRING` vs `TEXT`) when you need to explicitly define them in macros?

<back>

dbt uses **`type_*` macros** (such as `dbt.type_string()`, `dbt.type_numeric()`, or `dbt.type_timestamp()`). calling these macros returns the specific data type name required by the currently connected adapter/warehouse.
