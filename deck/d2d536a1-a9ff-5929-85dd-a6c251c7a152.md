  explanation: "The reference text lists `type_string`, `type_numeric`, and `type_timestamp` as data type functions but does not explicitly state their behavior or confirm that they return adapter-specific data type names, as claimed in the answer. Insufficient information is provided to verify the functionality."

<front>

How does dbt handle differences in data type names (e.g., `VARCHAR` vs `STRING` vs `TEXT`) when you need to explicitly define them in macros?

<back>

dbt uses **`type_*` macros** (such as `dbt.type_string()`, `dbt.type_numeric()`, or `dbt.type_timestamp()`). calling these macros returns the specific data type name required by the currently connected adapter/warehouse.
