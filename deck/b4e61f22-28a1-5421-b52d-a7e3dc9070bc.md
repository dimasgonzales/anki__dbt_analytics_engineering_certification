<front>

You want to tag specific models to be automatically picked up by a custom macro that generates documentation, but standard dbt tags are insufficient. How would you configure this in YAML?

<back>

You should use the `meta` config to define a custom property. For example:

```yaml
models:
  - name: my_model
    config:
      meta:
        include_in_custom_docs: true
```
The macro can then check `model.config.meta.include_in_custom_docs`.
