  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly supports that seeds are designed for static, version-controlled data like country codes and should not be used for large raw data exports. However, it does not mention sensitive PII or security optimization, so the claim about avoiding sensitive PII cannot be verified."
  citation:
    quote: "Seeds should not be used to load raw data (for example, large CSV exports from a production database). Since seeds are version controlled, they are best suited to files that contain business-specific logic, for example a list of country codes or user IDs of employees."

<front>

What is the primary use case for dbt seeds, and what type of data should generally be avoided?

<back>

Seeds are designed for static, infrequently changing data that benefits from version control (e.g., country codes, internal mapping lists). 

They should **not** be used for large raw data exports or sensitive PII, as they are not optimized for performance or security like standard ETL/ELT processes.
