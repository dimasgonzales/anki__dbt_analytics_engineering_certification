<front>

You have configured `threads: 8` in your `profiles.yml` for a Snowflake target using dbt Fusion. Why might you observe more than 8 concurrent queries running during execution?

This occurs because dbt Fusion treats the `threads: 8` setting as a hint rather than a strict cap on Snowflake. The engine dynamically adjusts parallelism based on the warehouse's real-time capabilities, potentially exceeding the configured value to optimize performance.
