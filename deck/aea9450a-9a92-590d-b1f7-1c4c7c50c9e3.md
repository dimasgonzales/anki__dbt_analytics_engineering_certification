  explanation: "The Reference Text discusses analyzing Snowflake query plans and performance issues in dbt models, such as data spilling and query optimization, but it does not mention dbt Fusion, thread configurations in `profiles.yml`, or how parallelism is managed. Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the answer."

<front>

You have configured `threads: 8` in your `profiles.yml` for a Snowflake target using dbt Fusion. Why might you observe more than 8 concurrent queries running during execution?

<back>

This occurs because dbt Fusion treats the `threads: 8` setting as a hint rather than a strict cap on Snowflake. The engine dynamically adjusts parallelism based on the warehouse's real-time capabilities, potentially exceeding the configured value to optimize performance.
