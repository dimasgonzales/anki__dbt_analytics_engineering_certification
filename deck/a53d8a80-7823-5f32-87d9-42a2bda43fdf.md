<front>

You are setting up a CI/CD pipeline and need to parse the file containing the success/fail status of your `dbt test` execution. Which file should you target?

</front>

<back>

You should target `run_results.json`.

Commands that execute nodes—such as `dbt test`, `dbt run`, and `dbt build`—always output their execution timing and status to `run_results.json`. `sources.json` is only relevant if you are specifically checking source freshness.
