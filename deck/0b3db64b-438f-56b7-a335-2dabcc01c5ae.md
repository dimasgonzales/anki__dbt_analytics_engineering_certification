<front>

You are working in Snowflake (which supports zero-copy) and execute `dbt clone` on a source object that is a View. What object type is created in the target schema?

<back>

It creates a **View** (specifically a pointer view).

Even on platforms that support zero-copy cloning for tables, if the source object is a View or Ephemeral model, `dbt clone` reverts to creating a pointer view (`select * from source`) because views cannot be zero-copy cloned like tables.
