<front>

A model named `orders` has versions `v: 1` and `v: 2` defined in its YAML, but no `latest_version` property is set.

What happens when you run a downstream model that references `{{ ref('orders') }}`?

<back>

dbt resolves the reference to **version 2**.

Since `latest_version` was not explicitly configured, dbt applies implicit logic to select the highest available version identifier (`v: 2`) as the default target.
