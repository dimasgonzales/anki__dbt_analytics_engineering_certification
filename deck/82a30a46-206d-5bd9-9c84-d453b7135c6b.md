  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly describes the use of the `relation_alias` argument in the `dbt_utils.star` macro to prefix column names with an alias, which directly supports the answer's claim that it prevents 'ambiguous column name' errors in queries involving joins by specifying which table columns belong to."
  citation:
    quote: "If you want to alias all fields in a model with the same alias without having to explicitly rename them all, you can also use the `star` macro with the `relation_alias` argument passed in... Now, this will return all fields from `table_a` with the `my_new_alias.field_name` naming format."

<front>

When using `dbt_utils.star` in a query involving joins, which argument is required to prevent 'ambiguous column name' errors?

</front>

<back>

The `relation_alias` argument. It prefixes every generated column name with the specified alias (e.g., `alias_name.col_name`), ensuring the database knows which table the columns belong to when multiple tables share column names.
