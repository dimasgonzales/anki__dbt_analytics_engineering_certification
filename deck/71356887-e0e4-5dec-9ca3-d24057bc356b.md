  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text supports the core claims in the Answer about storing test failure results, including saving offending rows to tables, dedicated schema with customizable naming, separate tables per test, and replacement of previous failures. However, specific details like the command-line option '--store-failures' and test logs providing select statements are not explicitly mentioned in the text, but the overall mechanism is validated."

How can you store test failure results in the database for later analysis?

Passing the `--store-failures` option to `dbt test`. This will save the "offending" rows that caused the test failure to a table in your database. The test logs will give you a simple select statement for you to run to retrieve said data. This data will be stored in a dedicated schema (default name is <your schema>\_dbt\_test\_\_audit, but this can be customized), with a separate table per failing test. By default, each test run results in a full truncation of each log table (so results from previous failed test runs are lost). However, there are packages/workarounds that can enable you to store full test execution history in perpetuity, if needed.
