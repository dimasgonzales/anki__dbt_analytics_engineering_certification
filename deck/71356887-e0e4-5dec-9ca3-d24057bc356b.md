How can you store test failure results in the database for later analysis?

Passing the `--store-failures` option to `dbt test`. This will save the "offending" rows that caused the test failure to a table in your database. The test logs will give you a simple select statement for you to run to retrieve said data. This data will be stored in a dedicated schema (default name is <your schema>\_dbt\_test\_\_audit, but this can be customized), with a separate table per failing test. By default, each test run results in a full truncation of each log table (so results from previous failed test runs are lost). However, there are packages/workarounds that can enable you to store full test execution history in perpetuity, if needed.
