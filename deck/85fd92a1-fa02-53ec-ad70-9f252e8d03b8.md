<front>

A dbt model fails with an error stating that the function `date_part` does not exist for argument types `(text, integer)`. Is this a parsing or binding error, and why?

</front>

<back>

This is a **Binding (Semantic) error**. The SQL syntax (structure) is likely correct, but the database compiler failed during the binding phase because the data types provided do not match the function's definition (signature).
