<front>

You are writing a generic test to ensure a `price` column is always positive. You write the following logic:

```sql
select * 
from {{ model }}
where {{ column_name }} > 0
```

What will happen when this test runs?

</front>

<back>

The test will **fail** for all valid records. 

This logic selects rows where the price is positive (valid data). dbt expects you to select **invalid** data (failures). You should invert the logic to select rows where the price is negative or zero:

```sql
where {{ column_name }} <= 0
```

</back>
