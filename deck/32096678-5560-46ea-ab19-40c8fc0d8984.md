What are project-level tests in dbt?
</front>

**Project tests** are tests that check things across the entire dbt project. These are generally "meta-tests" of sorts, e.g. "check that every model has unique and not\_null tests applied to it" or "is every column documented in a certain way". This can be a way of measuring/enforcing something like a test coverage metric in a dbt project. Packages (e.g. the popular dbt\_meta\_testing package) can help with this. Project tests must be defined in the `dbt_project.yml` file that sits at the root of every dbt project.
