  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text includes a YAML example where `loaded_at_field` is defined at the source level with a comment indicating it applies to all sources, and it is overridden at a specific table level, directly supporting the cascading and override behavior described in the answer."

<front>

In `sources.yml`, how does defining a property like `loaded_at_field` at the top source level affect the tables nested underneath it?

<back>

Properties defined at the source level **cascade** down to all tables within that source group. This applies the configuration to every table unless it is explicitly overridden at the individual table level.
