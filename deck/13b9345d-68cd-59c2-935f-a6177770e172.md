What are the **five built-in** incremental strategy options in dbt, and how does each generally handle existing data?

The five built-in strategies and their handling of existing data are:

1.  **`merge`**: Upserts rows based on a unique key (updates matches, inserts new).
2.  **`delete+insert`**: Deletes rows matching a unique key, then inserts all new rows.
3.  **`append`**: Inserts new rows without checking for duplicates.
4.  **`insert_overwrite`**: Replaces entire partitions in the destination table based on the new data.
5.  **`microbatch`**: (Used by Databricks/Spark) Processes incremental data in smaller, more manageable batches, often used for performance optimization.
