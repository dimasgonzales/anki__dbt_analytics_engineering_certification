  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that for BigQuery quoting configuration, the 'schema' key is used, and it applies to 'dataset' names. This supports the answer's claim that setting 'schema: true' under the 'quoting' property enables quoting for a BigQuery dataset, as 'schema' corresponds to 'dataset' in BigQuery."

<front>

You need to enable quoting for a BigQuery Dataset named `marketing-data` because it contains a hyphen. How do you configure this in your `sources.yml`?

You must set the `schema` key to `true` under the `quoting` property.

```yaml
quoting:
  schema: true
```
In dbt's BigQuery adapter, the `schema` property controls the quoting of the Dataset name.
