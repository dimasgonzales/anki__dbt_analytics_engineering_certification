<front>

You need to enable quoting for a BigQuery Dataset named `marketing-data` because it contains a hyphen. How do you configure this in your `sources.yml`?

You must set the `schema` key to `true` under the `quoting` property.

```yaml
quoting:
  schema: true
```
In dbt's BigQuery adapter, the `schema` property controls the quoting of the Dataset name.
