  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly lists the order of precedence for dbt configurations, where using a config() Jinja macro within a model (answer's model-level config() block) has the highest priority over configurations from dbt_project.yml."
  citation:
    quote: "wing ways, listed in order of precedence: 1. Using a `config()` Jinja macro within a model. 2. Using a `config` [resource property] in a `.yml` file. 3. From the `dbt_project.yml` project file, under the `models:` key."

<front>

Which configuration takes precedence: a setting defined in `dbt_project.yml` or a setting defined in a model's `{{ config() }}` block?

<back>

The model-level `{{ config() }}` block takes precedence.

dbt applies configurations hierarchically, where the most specific scope overrides the general project configuration.
