<front>

You are building an incremental model on Postgres with the configuration below. You notice that dbt deletes existing records before inserting new ones rather than performing a merge. Why?

```sql
{{ config(
    materialized='incremental',
    unique_key='transaction_id'
) }}
```

</front>

<back>

This happens because the default incremental strategy for Postgres when a `unique_key` is present is `delete+insert`. To use a different behavior (like `merge`), you must explicitly set the `incremental_strategy` config if the adapter supports it.
