  explanation: "The Reference Text demonstrates how sources can be configured to use different databases based on the target environment, which aligns with the answer's description of {{ source() }} dynamically resolving to raw_dev or raw_prod without manual changes."

<front>

You are deploying code to Production. Your `dev` profile targets the `raw_dev` database, but your `prod` profile targets `raw_prod`. How does using `{{ source() }}` ensure the code works in both environments without manual changes?

<back>

The `source()` function compiles dynamically at runtime based on the active environment configuration (profiles.yml). It automatically resolves to `raw_dev.schema.table` in development and `raw_prod.schema.table` in production, keeping the underlying model code environment-agnostic.
