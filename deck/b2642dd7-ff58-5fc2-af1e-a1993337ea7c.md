<front>

You are deploying code to Production. Your `dev` profile targets the `raw_dev` database, but your `prod` profile targets `raw_prod`. How does using `{{ source() }}` ensure the code works in both environments without manual changes?

The `source()` function compiles dynamically at runtime based on the active environment configuration (profiles.yml). It automatically resolves to `raw_dev.schema.table` in development and `raw_prod.schema.table` in production, keeping the underlying model code environment-agnostic.
