<front>

A downstream project is failing with a compilation error when trying to reference your model `dim_customers`, even though the project dependency is set up correctly. What is the most likely configuration issue in the upstream model?

</front>

<back>

The upstream model `dim_customers` likely does not have its access set to `public`. You must explicitly configure this in the YAML to allow cross-project references.

Example:
```yaml
models:
  - name: dim_customers
    config:
      access: public
```

</back>
