<front>
What **dbt\_project.yml** field is used to specify whether dbt should quote databases, schemas, and identifiers? What is the default? In what contexts will quoting happen (if specified)?
</front>

<back>

```
quoting:
database: true | false
schema: true | false
identifier: true | false
```For most adapters, quoting is set to "true" across the board by default. For Snowflake, the default is "false", because quoting identifiers in Snowflake makes them case-sensitive, which is often not desireable.  
  
Identifiers will be quoted when:  

- creating relations
- resolving a "ref" function to a direct reference
