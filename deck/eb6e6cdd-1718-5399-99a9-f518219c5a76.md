  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly distinguishes between Jinja expressions using `{{ }}` and statements using `{% %}`, which directly supports the answer's description of their functional differences in outputting values and handling control flow."
  citation:
    quote: "The rule is that you're within a Jinja expression or statement (i.e. within `{% ... %}` or `{{ ... }}`), you'll need to use quotes for any arguments that are strings."

<front>

What is the functional difference between the `{{ }}` and `{% %}` delimiters in Jinja?

1. `{{ }}` are for **Expressions**: They output text or values (e.g., variables, macro results) to the compiled SQL.
2. `{% %}` are for **Statements**: They handle control flow (loops, logic) or definitions and do *not* output text directly.
