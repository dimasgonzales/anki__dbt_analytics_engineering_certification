<front>

Your incremental model updates user records. However, the `first_acquisition_date` column is being overwritten with the current run's timestamp every time the user record updates. How do you resolve this while keeping the other updates?

<back>

Configure `merge_exclude_columns` for the `first_acquisition_date` field.
This ensures that while mutable fields (like `last_login`) are updated via the merge strategy, the acquisition date retains its original value from the first insertion.
```yaml
{{ config(
  materialized='incremental',
  unique_key='user_id',
  incremental_strategy='merge',
  merge_exclude_columns=['first_acquisition_date']
) }}
```
