<front>

What is the definition of the graph selection executed by the `@` operator (e.g., `dbt run --select @my_model`)?

</front>

<back>

The `@` operator selects:
1. The specified model (`my_model`)
2. All descendants of that model
3. All **ancestors** of those descendants

It basically grabs the model, everything downstream, and everything required to build that downstream lineage.
