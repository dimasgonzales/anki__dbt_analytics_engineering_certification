  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly defines the @ operator as selecting the model, its children (descendants), and the parents of its children (ancestors of descendants), which directly matches the answer's description of selecting the model, all descendants, and all ancestors of those descendants."

<front>

What is the definition of the graph selection executed by the `@` operator (e.g., `dbt run --select @my_model`)?

<back>

The `@` operator selects:
1. The specified model (`my_model`)
2. All descendants of that model
3. All **ancestors** of those descendants

It basically grabs the model, everything downstream, and everything required to build that downstream lineage.
