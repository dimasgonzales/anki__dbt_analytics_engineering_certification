<front>

You have a complex definition for 'Monthly Recurring Revenue' that spans multiple paragraphs and is used in 10 different models. How should you manage this documentation to follow DRY principles?

</front>

<back>

Define the text once in a `.md` file using `{% docs doc_name %}` tags, and reference it in the YAML for all 10 models using the `{{ doc('doc_name') }}` function. This ensures updates only need to happen in one place.
