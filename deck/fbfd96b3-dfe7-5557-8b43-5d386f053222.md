<front>

You are writing a model and simply type `FROM raw.stripe.payments`. What are two negative consequences of doing this instead of using the `source()` function?

<back>

1. **Broken Lineage:** dbt cannot build the dependency graph (DAG) for this model.
2. **No Freshness Checks:** You cannot use `dbt source freshness` to alert on stale data.

Always define the source in YAML and reference it with `{{ source('stripe', 'payments') }}`.
