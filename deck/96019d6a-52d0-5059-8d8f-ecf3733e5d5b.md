  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that in dbt Fusion, the threads setting is not a strict limit but serves as guidance for dynamic optimization in most warehouses, and specifically for Redshift, it acts as a strict limit to manage concurrency constraints."
  citation:
    quote: "In Redshift, the `threads` setting limits the number of queries or statements that can run in parallel, which is important for managing Redshift's concurrency limits. In other warehouses, Fusion dynamically adjusts thread usage based on each warehouse's capabilities, using your thread configuration as guidance while automatically optimizing for maximum efficiency."

<front>

How does the dbt Fusion Engine interpret the `threads` configuration setting in `profiles.yml` differently from standard dbt Core?

<back>

In dbt Fusion, the `threads` setting generally acts as **guidance** for dynamic optimization rather than a strict hard limit like in dbt Core. However, for **Redshift** targets specifically, Fusion maintains the strict limit to manage that platform's specific concurrency constraints.
