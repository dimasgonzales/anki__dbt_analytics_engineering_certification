<front>

You manage two separate dbt projects: 'Ingestion' and 'Transformation'. You need the 'Transformation' job to run strictly *after* the 'Ingestion' job succeeds. How do you configure this in dbt Cloud?

</front>

<back>

In the 'Transformation' job settings, go to the **Triggers** section and enable **Run when another job finishes**.

Select the 'Ingestion' project and job, and set the condition to triggers on **Success**. This creates a dependency chain ensuring 'Transformation' only runs when data ingestion is complete.
