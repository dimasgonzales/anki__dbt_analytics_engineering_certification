  explanation: "The reference text mentions 'Run pre-hooks' and 'Run post-model hooks' as steps in a materialization, which correspond to the first two steps in the answer. However, it does not mention 'Commit Transaction' as a critical step or provide evidence for its necessity in managing the model execution lifecycle. Additionally, the specific syntax and the three-step framework are not verified by the provided text."

1. **Run Pre-hooks**: Execute `{{ run_hooks(pre_hooks) }}` before the main SQL.
2. **Run Post-hooks**: Execute `{{ run_hooks(post_hooks) }}` after the main SQL.
3. **Commit Transaction**: Explicitly call `{{ adapter.commit() }}` at the end to finalize the database changes.
