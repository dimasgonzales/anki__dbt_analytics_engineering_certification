  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that exposures are defined in .yml files using the top-level exposures key, which supports the second part of the answer regarding where exposures are defined. However, it does not contain information defining what an exposure is, such as it being a resource for downstream consumers, so the first part of the answer cannot be verified with the provided text."

<back>

An exposure is a resource that defines a downstream consumer of your dbt project, such as a dashboard or application, extending the DAG lineage beyond the warehouse. Exposures are defined in `.yml` files using the top-level `exposures:` key.
