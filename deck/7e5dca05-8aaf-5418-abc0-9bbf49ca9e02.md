  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly supports the need for unique development schemas to prevent developers from overwriting each other's work, which is a key aspect of environment isolation mentioned in the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "Each dbt user has their own target schema for development... If dbt ignored the target schema and only used the model's custom schema, every dbt user would create models in the same schema and would overwrite each other's work."

To maintain **Environment Isolation**. This prevents developers from overwriting each other's work or modifying production data while building and testing features on their own branches.
