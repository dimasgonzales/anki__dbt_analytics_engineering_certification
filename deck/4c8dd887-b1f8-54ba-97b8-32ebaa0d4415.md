  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text confirms that external packages are defined in a file named 'packages.yml' (or alternatively 'dependencies.yml') located at the project root, and the specific release is identified using the 'version' key under the package name, as demonstrated in the example."
  citation:
    quote: "Add a file named `dependencies.yml` or `packages.yml` to your dbt project. This should be at the same level as your `dbt_project.yml` file. 2. Specify the package(s) you wish to add using one of the supported syntaxes, for example:  ``` packages:     - package: dbt-labs/snowplow       version: 0.7.0   ```"

<front>

In which file must you define external libraries to import them into your dbt project, and what syntax identifies the specific release to use?

<back>

External libraries are defined in the `packages.yml` file located in the project root. You identify the specific release using the `version` key under the package name.

Example:
```yaml
packages:
  - package: dbt-labs/dbt_utils
    version: 1.0.0
```
