<front>

In which file must you define external libraries to import them into your dbt project, and what syntax identifies the specific release to use?

</front>

<back>

External libraries are defined in the `packages.yml` file located in the project root. You identify the specific release using the `version` key under the package name.

Example:
```yaml
packages:
  - package: dbt-labs/dbt_utils
    version: 1.0.0
```
