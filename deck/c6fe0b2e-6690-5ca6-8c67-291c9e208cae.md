  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly confirms that the default directory for installed packages is 'dbt_packages' and that running 'dbt deps' installs packages in this directory, which aligns with the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "The default [`packages-install-path`](/reference/project-configs/packages-install-path) is `dbt_packages`. Run `dbt deps` to install the package(s). Packages get installed in the `dbt_packages` directory (packages/rank_1.md)."

<front>

If no custom path is configured, what is the default directory for installed dependencies, and which command creates it?

<back>

The default directory is `dbt_packages`. This directory is created and populated when you run the `dbt deps` command.

Note: Prior to dbt v1.0, the default was sometimes `dbt_modules`, but `dbt_packages` is the modern standard.
