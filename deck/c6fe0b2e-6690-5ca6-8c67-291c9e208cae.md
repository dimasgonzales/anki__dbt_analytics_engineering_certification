<front>

If no custom path is configured, what is the default directory for installed dependencies, and which command creates it?

<back>

The default directory is `dbt_packages`. This directory is created and populated when you run the `dbt deps` command.

Note: Prior to dbt v1.0, the default was sometimes `dbt_modules`, but `dbt_packages` is the modern standard.
