<front>

A dbt model is failing with a generic "Database Error" and you cannot see the specific SQL causing the issue in the console. What is the first troubleshooting step?

Re-run the command with `--debug`.

Example:
```bash
dbt run --select my_model --debug
```
This will display the exact SQL query generated by dbt and the detailed error response from the data warehouse.
