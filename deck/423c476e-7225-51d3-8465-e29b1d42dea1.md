  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer is explicitly supported by the reference text, which directly confirms all key points: properties are declared in YAML files, configs can be set in multiple places and applied hierarchically, selection based on config values is possible, and the rule of thumb distinguishing properties and configs."
  citation:
    quote: "Properties are declared for resources one-by-one in `properties.yml` files. Configs can be defined there, nested under a `config` property. They can also be set one-by-one via a `config()` macro (right within `.sql` files), and for many resources at once in `dbt_project.yml`. Because configs can be set in multiple places, they are also applied hierarchically. An individual resource might *inherit* or *override* configs set elsewhere. You can select resources based on their config values using the `config:` selection method, but not the values of non-config properties. A rule of thumb: properties declare things *about* your project resources; configs go the extra step of telling dbt *how* to build those resources in your warehouse."

What are the main differences between resource **configs** and resource **properties**?

- Properties are declared for resources one-by-one in `.yml` files. Configs can be defined there, nested under a `config` property. They can also be set one-by-one via a `config()` macro (right within `.sql` files), and for many resources at once in `dbt_project.yml.`
- Because configs can be set in multiple places, they are also applied hierarchically. An individual resource might inherit or override configs set elsewhere.
- You can select resources based on their config values using the `config:` selection method, but not the values of non-config properties

A rule of thumb: properties declare things about your project resources; configs go the extra step of telling dbt how to build those resources in your warehouse. This is generally true, but not always, so it's always good to check!
