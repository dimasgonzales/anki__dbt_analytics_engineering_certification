  explanation: "The Reference Text describes the functionality and usage of the dbt_utils.star macro, such as generating a comma-separated list of fields and excluding specific columns, but it does not provide any details on the underlying mechanism, such as database introspection, information schema queries, or the compilation phase. Therefore, the answer cannot be verified from the given text."

<back>

It uses database introspection during the compilation phase. Helper macros query the information schema (e.g., using `adapter.get_columns_in_relation`) to retrieve the existing column names before the final SQL is compiled.
