<front>

A developer deleted the `grants` block from a model's configuration to revoke access, but the permissions persist in the database. Why?

Removing the configuration tells dbt to stop managing grants for that model, leaving the database in its current state (unmanaged). To actually revoke access, you must first set the grant to an empty list `[]` so dbt runs the revoke statement.
