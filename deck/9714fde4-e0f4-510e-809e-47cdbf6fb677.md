  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that deleting the grants block stops dbt from managing grants without altering the database, and setting it to an empty list is necessary to revoke access."
  citation:
    quote: "If you delete the entire `+grants` section, dbt assumes you no longer want it to manage grants and doesn't change anything. To have dbt revoke all existing grants from a node, provide an empty list of grantees."

<front>

A developer deleted the `grants` block from a model's configuration to revoke access, but the permissions persist in the database. Why?

<back>

Removing the configuration tells dbt to stop managing grants for that model, leaving the database in its current state (unmanaged). To actually revoke access, you must first set the grant to an empty list `[]` so dbt runs the revoke statement.
