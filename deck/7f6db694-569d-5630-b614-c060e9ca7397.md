  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that datatypes for dbt seed columns can be set in the dbt_project.yml file using the column_types configuration to override automatic type inference, which directly supports the answer's claim. The answer mentions +column_types, which is consistent with dbt's configuration syntax where '+' may be used for resource properties, and the core method is confirmed."

<front>

How do you configure specific data types for dbt seed columns to prevent default inference errors?

<back>

You define them in the `dbt_project.yml` file using the `+column_types` configuration under the specific seed resource. This overrides dbt's automatic type inference.
