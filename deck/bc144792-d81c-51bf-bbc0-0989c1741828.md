<front>

When configuring a dbt model to create a materialized view on Snowflake versus other adapters (like Postgres or BigQuery), what specific materialization types must be used?

</front>

<back>

For **Snowflake**, you must use `materialized='dynamic_table'`. 
For most other adapters (Postgres, Redshift, BigQuery, Databricks), use `materialized='materialized_view'`.

Snowflake uses Dynamic Tables as its native implementation of declarative, continuously updating views.
