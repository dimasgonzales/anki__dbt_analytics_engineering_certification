<front>

A colleague has written a business definition for a 'churned_user' column as a comment inside the SQL file: `select id, -- User is churned if inactive > 30 days`. Why is this approach incorrect for dbt documentation?

<back>

Inline comments are not parsed into the dbt documentation site. To make this definition visible to stakeholders in the generated docs, it must be moved to the `description` property in the model's YAML file.
