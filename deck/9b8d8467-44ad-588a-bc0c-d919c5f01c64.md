<front>

What is the function of 'deferral' in dbt Cloud CI jobs?

</front>

<back>

Deferral allows dbt to reference upstream models (manifest) from a different environment (usually Production) when they don't exist in the current environment. This prevents the need to rebuild the entire DAG for every CI check, saving significant time and compute costs.
