  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly supports the answer by describing deferral as a mechanism to use the project representation (manifest) from a different environment, such as production, to avoid rebuilding models, thereby saving time and resources in CI jobs."
  citation:
    quote: "Deferral to an environment is more efficient as dbt will compare against the project representation (which is stored in the `manifest.json`) of the last successful deploy job run that executed in the deferred environment."

<front>

What is the function of 'deferral' in dbt Cloud CI jobs?

<back>

Deferral allows dbt to reference upstream models (manifest) from a different environment (usually Production) when they don't exist in the current environment. This prevents the need to rebuild the entire DAG for every CI check, saving significant time and compute costs.
