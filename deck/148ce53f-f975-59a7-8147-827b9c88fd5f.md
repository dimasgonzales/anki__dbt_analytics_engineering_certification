  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that Python models can only be materialized as tables or incremental models and do not support materializing as views, which supports parts of the answer. However, it does not contain any information about ephemeral materialization, so the claim regarding ephemeral cannot be verified."

<front>

Which materialization types are supported for Python models in dbt?

<back>

Python models only support **table** and **incremental** materializations.

They **cannot** be materialized as `view` or `ephemeral`.
