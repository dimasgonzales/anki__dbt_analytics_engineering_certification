<front>

You are reviewing a Pull Request in dbt Cloud and want to verify if a logic change in the `calculate_revenue` model actually altered the data output compared to production. How can you confirm this via the UI?

</front>

<back>

Open the CI Job run associated with the PR and navigate to the **Compare** tab. Locate the `calculate_revenue` model; if the tool displays "modified rows" in red/green, it indicates that the logic change resulted in data differences compared to the production state.
