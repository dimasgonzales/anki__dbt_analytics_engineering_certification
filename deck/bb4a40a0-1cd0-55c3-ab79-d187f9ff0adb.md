  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text mentions that analyses are compiled and stored in the target/compiled directory, but it does not explicitly state the command 'dbt compile' or the exact output path 'target/compiled/{project_name}/analyses/{filename}.sql' for analyses files."
  citation:
    quote: "Any .sql files found in the analyses/ directory of a dbt project will be compiled, but not executed."

<front>

Which dbt command allows you to see the resolved SQL for a file in the `analyses/` directory, and where is the output located?

<back>

Run `dbt compile`. The resolved SQL (with Jinja replaced by actual SQL) is generated in the `target/` directory path:
```bash
target/compiled/{project_name}/analyses/{filename}.sql
```

</back>
