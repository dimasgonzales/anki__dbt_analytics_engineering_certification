  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly describes that `dbt run --full-refresh` causes dbt to drop the target table and rebuild it, which matches the answer's claim about dropping and recreating relations. It also provides an example of using it with incremental models, supporting the usage context."

    quote: "cause dbt to drop the existing target table in the database before rebuilding it for all-time."
