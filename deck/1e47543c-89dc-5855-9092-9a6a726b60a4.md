  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Answer correctly states that `dbt compile` compiles source code into executable SQL without running it against the data warehouse, and saves files to a target directory for inspection. The Reference explicitly supports the compilation and directory aspects, and implies no execution during compilation."
  citation:
    quote: "\"`dbt compile` generates executable SQL from source `model`, `test`, and `analysis` files. You can find these compiled SQL files in the `target/` directory of your dbt project.\""

What is the primary purpose of the `dbt compile` command?

<back>

The `dbt compile` command compiles source code (SQL and Jinja) into executable SQL without running it against the data warehouse. It resolves all refs, macros, and variables, saving the resulting SQL files to the `target/compiled` directory for inspection.
