<front>

You are setting up a CI/CD pipeline step that runs `dbt test`. The dbt project is located in a subdirectory named `analytics`. How would you write the command to run successfully from the repo root?

</front>

<back>

You must point dbt to the correct directory using the project directory flag.

**Command:**
```bash
dbt test --project-dir analytics
```

Alternatively, you could `cd analytics` before running the command.
