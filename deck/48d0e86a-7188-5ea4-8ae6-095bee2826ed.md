<front>

You have a dbt Cloud job configured with two steps:
1. `dbt run`
2. `dbt test`

If `dbt run` encounters a SQL error in a model, what happens to the `dbt test` step?

</front>

<back>

The `dbt test` step is **skipped**.

Because the first command failed (returned a non-zero exit code), dbt Cloud halts the job execution sequence to prevent cascading failures or testing invalid data.
