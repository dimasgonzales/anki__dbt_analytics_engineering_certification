You need to snapshot a source table that lacks a reliable `last_modified` timestamp. How should you configure the snapshot block?

You should use the `check` strategy. This requires configuring `check_cols` to specify which columns dbt should compare to detect changes, rather than relying on an `updated_at` column.
```yaml
strategy: check
check_cols: ['status', 'amount']
```
