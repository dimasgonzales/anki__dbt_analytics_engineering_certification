<front>

You have a high-cost model that should only run if the upstream `stripe.payments` table has received new data in the last hour. How would you configure this in dbt Cloud?

<back>

You would configure a **State-aware job** (or freshness-based trigger). First, define freshness thresholds in your `sources.yml`:
```yaml
freshness:
  warn_after: {count: 1, period: hour}
```
The job will check source freshness first and only run the models if the source data meets the criteria for an update.
