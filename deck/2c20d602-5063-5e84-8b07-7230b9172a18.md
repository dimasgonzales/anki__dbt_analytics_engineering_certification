  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer correctly describes dbt Cloud's state-aware orchestration mechanism, which is explicitly detailed in the reference text involving hash comparison stored in Redis."
  citation:
    quote: "State-aware orchestration uses a cached hash of both code and data state for each model in an environment stored in Redis. When running a job, dbt checks if there are changes in the hash for the model being built between the saved state in Redis and the current state that would be built by the job. If there is a change, dbt builds the model. If there are no changes, dbt reuses the model from the last time it was built."

<front>

How does dbt Cloud's state-aware orchestration determine whether to rebuild a model or reuse an existing artifact?

</front>

<back>

dbt compares a hash of the current code and data state against a saved state hash stored in Redis. If the hash is unchanged, dbt reuses the existing model artifact; if the hash differs, dbt rebuilds the model.
