<front>

You are setting up a new dbt project that utilizes Python models. You add the Python model file, but dbt throws an error saying the functionality is not supported. What configuration should you check in `dbt_project.yml`?

You should check the `require-dbt-version` configuration. Python models were introduced in dbt v1.3, so you must ensure the project explicitly requires a compatible version:

```yaml
require-dbt-version: ">=1.3.0"
```
