  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text confirms that materialization settings can be overridden at the directory level, which directly supports the answer's assertion that more specific configurations (like subdirectories) override general ones (like root level)."
  citation:
    quote: "By default, everything gets created as a view. You can override that at the directory level so everything in that directory will materialize to a different materialization."
