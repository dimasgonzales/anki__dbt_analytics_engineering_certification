<front>

A specific model in your project is materialized as a `table`. The model is performant for BI users, but it takes over an hour to rebuild during your daily job, delaying the pipeline. How should you resolve this?

<back>

Refactor the model to use the `incremental` materialization.

This will optimize the **build time** by only processing new or changed records, addressing the pipeline bottleneck while maintaining the physical table structure for fast querying.
