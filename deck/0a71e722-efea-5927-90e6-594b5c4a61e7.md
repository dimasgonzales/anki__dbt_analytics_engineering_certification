  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly lists 'dbt docs generate' and 'dbt docs serve' as commands, and other sources state that 'dbt docs' generates and serves documentation, which supports the answer's core claims about sub-commands and their basic functions. However, specific operational details such as port number, configurability, and the requirement to generate first are not mentioned in the provided text."

What does the `dbt docs` command do, and what are its sub-commands?

`dbt docs generate` generates your project's documentation website  
  
`dbt docs serve` starts a webserver on port 8000 (this is configurable) to serve your documentation site locally and opens the site in your default browser. The docs must have been generated first.
