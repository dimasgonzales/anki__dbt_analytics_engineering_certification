What does the `dbt docs` command do, and what are its sub-commands?

`dbt docs generate` generates your project's documentation website  
  
`dbt docs serve` starts a webserver on port 8000 (this is configurable) to serve your documentation site locally and opens the site in your default browser. The docs must have been generated first.
