  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that 'dbt docs' has subcommands 'generate' and 'serve', and describes 'generate' as generating the documentation website. However, it does not contain information to verify the specific details of 'serve' mentioned in the answer, such as the default port 8000, configurability, or browser opening."

<front>

What does the `dbt docs` command do, and what are its sub-commands?

<back>

`dbt docs generate` generates your project's documentation website  
  
`dbt docs serve` starts a webserver on port 8000 (this is configurable) to serve your documentation site locally and opens the site in your default browser. The docs must have been generated first.
