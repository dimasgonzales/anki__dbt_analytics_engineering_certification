  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly supports the answer by stating that for materialized views, dbt run acts as a deploy action for configuration or SQL changes, while for tables, it is required for both configuration changes and data updates, with materialized views often having automatic refresh managed by the database."
  citation:
    quote: "In the context of a `dbt run` command, materialized views should be thought of as similar to views. For example, a `dbt run` command is only needed if there is the potential for a change in configuration or sql; it's effectively a deploy action. By contrast, a `dbt run` command is needed for a table in the same scenarios *AND when the data in the table needs to be updated*. However, most platforms (Postgres excluded) provide functionality to configure automatically refreshing a materialized view."

<front>

When using the `materialized_view` materialization (on supported adapters), what is the primary function of the `dbt run` command compared to a standard `table` materialization?

<back>

For a `materialized_view`, `dbt run` acts as a configuration deployment (updating the SQL definition), whereas for a `table`, it actively orchestrates the data transformation and insertion. The database itself usually manages the data refresh for materialized views.
