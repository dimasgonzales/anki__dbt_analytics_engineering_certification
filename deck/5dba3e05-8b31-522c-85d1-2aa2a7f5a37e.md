<front>

Your seed file contains a `phone_number` column. After running `dbt seed`, you notice leading zeros have been stripped and the database treats the column as an integer. How do you fix this?

Define the specific column type in your project configuration to cast it as a string:

```yaml
seeds:
  my_project:
    contacts:
      +column_types:
        phone_number: varchar(20)
```

</back>
