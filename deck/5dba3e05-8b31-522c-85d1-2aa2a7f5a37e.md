<front>

`dbt seed` is stripping leading zeros from a column (e.g., zip codes or phone numbers) because it infers the type as Integer.

How do you force dbt to treat the column as a String?

</front>

<back>

Override type inference using the **`column_types`** config in the seed's `.yml` properties file.

```yaml
seeds:
  - name: contacts
    config:
      column_types:
        phone_number: varchar(20)
```

</back>
