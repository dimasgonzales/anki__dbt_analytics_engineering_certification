  explanation: "The reference text shows the function signature 'def model(dbt, session):' which supports the name and arguments, but does not explicitly state that the function must return a DataFrame. Therefore, the entire answer, including the return requirement, cannot be fully verified based on the provided text."

<front>

What is the required function signature for defining a dbt Python model?

</front>

---

<back>

A dbt Python model must define a function named `model` that accepts exactly two arguments: `dbt` and `session`. This function must return a DataFrame to be materialized.

```python
def model(dbt, session):
    # ... logic ...
    return final_df
```
