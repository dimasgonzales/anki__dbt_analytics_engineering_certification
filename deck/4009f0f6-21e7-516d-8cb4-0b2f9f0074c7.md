  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer's core claim that dbt Cloud prevents schema collisions by creating unique, temporary schemas for each Pull Request run is explicitly supported by the reference text, which confirms that each PR gets its own schema. However, the specific naming convention mentioned is not addressed in the text."
  citation:
    quote: "If 10 developers all commit code to different PRs at the same time, each person will get their own schema containing their changes."

<back>

dbt Cloud creates a unique, temporary schema for each Pull Request run.

These schemas usually follow a naming convention like `dbt_cloud_pr_<job_id>_<pr_id>`, ensuring complete isolation between concurrent CI jobs.
