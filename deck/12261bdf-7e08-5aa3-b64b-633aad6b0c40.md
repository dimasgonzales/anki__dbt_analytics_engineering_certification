<front>

Your nightly `dbt build` job fails on a model that runs 2 hours into the process. How do you recover without wasting compute on the successful upstream models?

</front>

<back>

Run:
```bash
dbt retry
```

This command reads the `run_results.json` from the failed execution and restarts processing strictly from the point of failure, skipping the models that already succeeded.
