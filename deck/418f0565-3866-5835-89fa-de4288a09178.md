<front>

A model is configured with `materialized: view` in `dbt_project.yml` and `{{ config(materialized='table') }}` in the SQL file. How will dbt materialize this model?

<back>

It will be materialized as a **table**.

In-file configurations inside the `{{ config() }}` block have the highest precedence and will override conflicting configurations set in `.yml` files or the `dbt_project.yml` file.
