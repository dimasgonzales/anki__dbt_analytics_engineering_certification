  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text describes how to configure materializations in different files (e.g., dbt_project.yml, model SQL files) but does not provide any information on configuration precedence or how conflicting settings are resolved. There is no evidence to support or contradict the claim that in-file configurations override others."

<front>

A model is configured with `materialized: view` in `dbt_project.yml` and `{{ config(materialized='table') }}` in the SQL file. How will dbt materialize this model?

</front>

<back>

It will be materialized as a **table**.

In-file configurations inside the `{{ config() }}` block have the highest precedence and will override conflicting configurations set in `.yml` files or the `dbt_project.yml` file.
