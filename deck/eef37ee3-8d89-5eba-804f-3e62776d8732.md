<front>

You investigate a `dbt_project.yml` file and see no `materialized` configurations under the `models:` block. A user claims they are querying a table created by `stg_users.sql`, but performance is slow. What is the likely cause?

<back>

The model is likely built as a `view`, not a table. Since no materialization was specified, dbt applied the default `view` strategy, causing the transformation logic to run at query time rather than reading pre-computed data.
