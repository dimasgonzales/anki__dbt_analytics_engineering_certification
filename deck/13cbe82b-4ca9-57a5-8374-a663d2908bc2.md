<front>

You need to ensure that the `reporting_role` has `select` access to a specific incremental model named `fct_orders`. How would you configure this directly in the model file?

<back>

Add a `grants` key to the config block within the model file.

Example:
```sql
{{ config(
    materialized = 'incremental',
    grants = {'select': ['reporting_role']}
) }}
```

</back>
