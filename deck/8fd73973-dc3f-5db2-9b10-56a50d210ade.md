<front>

In a dbt Semantic Model, which fields are mandatory when defining a 'dimension', and when is the 'expr' field required?

<back>

The `name` and `type` (e.g., `categorical` or `time`) fields are mandatory. The `expr` field is optional; it is required only if the dimension relies on a SQL expression or if the underlying column name differs from the dimension `name`. If omitted, dbt looks for a column matching the dimension name.
