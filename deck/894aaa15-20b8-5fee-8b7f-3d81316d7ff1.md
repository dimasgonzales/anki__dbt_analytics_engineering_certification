<front>

You are migrating a downstream dashboard to use a new version of `dim_subscriptions`, but a legacy financial report must specifically use version 1. How do you reference the model in the legacy report's SQL?

</front>

<back>

You must pin the reference using the `v` (or `version`) argument in the `ref()` function.

Example:
```sql
select * from {{ ref('dim_subscriptions', v=1) }}
```

</back>
