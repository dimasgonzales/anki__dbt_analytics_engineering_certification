<front>

You are attempting to install a private package using the following configuration in `dependencies.yml`, but it is failing. What is the cause?

```yaml
packages:
  - git: "https://{{ env_var('GIT_TOKEN') }}@github.com/org/repo.git"
```

</front>

---

<back>

The failure occurs because `dependencies.yml` does not support Jinja rendering.

To fix this, you must move the configuration to `packages.yml`, which allows for the dynamic insertion of the environment variable.
