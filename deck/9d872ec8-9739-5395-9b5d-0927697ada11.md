<front>

You are configuring an incremental model on a warehouse that does not support the `merge` statement, but you need to ensure records are updated if they change. How would you configure the strategy?

</front>

<back>

Use the `delete+insert` strategy. This deletes rows from the destination table that match the `unique_key` in the new batch of data, then inserts the new records.

```sql
{{
  config(
    materialized = 'incremental',
    unique_key = 'id',
    incremental_strategy = 'delete+insert'
  )
}}
```

</back>
