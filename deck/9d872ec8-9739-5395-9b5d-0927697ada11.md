  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly describes that on warehouses not supporting merge, the incremental update method involves deleting matching records and inserting new ones, which aligns with the delete+insert strategy stated in the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "On warehouses that do not support `merge` statements, a merge is implemented by first using a `delete` statement to delete records in the target table that are to be updated, and then an `insert` statement."

<front>

You are configuring an incremental model on a warehouse that does not support the `merge` statement, but you need to ensure records are updated if they change. How would you configure the strategy?

Use the `delete+insert` strategy. This deletes rows from the destination table that match the `unique_key` in the new batch of data, then inserts the new records.

```sql
{{
  config(
    materialized = 'incremental',
    unique_key = 'id',
    incremental_strategy = 'delete+insert'
  )
}}
```

</back>
