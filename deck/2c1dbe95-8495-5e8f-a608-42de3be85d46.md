<front>

You are using the dbt Cloud CLI and want to build a specific model (`my_model`) while using production data for its upstream dependencies. What command do you run, and do you need manual deferral flags?

</front>

<back>

You simply run:
```bash
dbt run --select my_model
```
With the dbt Cloud CLI, deferral is automatic. You do **not** need to manually pass `--defer` or `--state` flags like in dbt Core; the CLI automatically resolves upstream dependencies using production artifacts.
