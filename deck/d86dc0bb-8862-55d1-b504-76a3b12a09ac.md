<front>

Your dbt Cloud job failed with a generic "Database Error" message. How would you locate the specific SQL error (e.g., "division by zero") associated with the failure?

<back>

Open the failed job run, navigate to the **Run Summary** tab, and expand the specific step that failed (usually `dbt run` or `dbt build`). Scroll through the log output to find the specific database error message returned for the failing model.
