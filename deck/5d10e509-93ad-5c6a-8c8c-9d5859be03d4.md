  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer is supported because the reference text explicitly states that native private packages can be defined in dependencies.yml, contrasting with the git token method which requires packages.yml."
  citation:
    quote: "If you're using [native private packages](/docs/build/packages#native-private-packages), you can define them in the `dependencies.yml` file."

<front>

When defining private dependencies, under what specific condition is it valid to use `dependencies.yml` instead of `packages.yml`?

<back>

It is valid when using **native private packages** (typically associated with dbt Cloud).

Because native private packages rely on platform-managed authentication rather than manual Jinja token injection, they do not require the rendering capabilities of `packages.yml`.
