  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that exposure orchestration is enabled by adding the environment variable `DBT_ACTIVE_EXPOSURES` and setting it to `1` in the dbt Cloud environment settings, which directly supports the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "Click **Add variable** and set the [environment level variable](/docs/build/environment-variables#setting-and-overriding-environment-variables) `DBT_ACTIVE_EXPOSURES` to `1` within the environment you want the refresh to happen."

<back>
