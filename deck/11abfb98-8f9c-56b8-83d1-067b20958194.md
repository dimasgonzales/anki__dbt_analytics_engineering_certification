  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text only describes the behavior of the explicit 'dbt source freshness' command, indicating it exits with a nonzero code upon failure, but does not mention the 'run source freshness' UI option or its behavior, so there is insufficient information to verify the answer's claim about the UI option."

<front>

What is the difference between checking the "run source freshness" box in the job creation UI vs. actually executing the `dbt source freshness` command as part of the job?

<back>

The freshness check resulting from selecting the UI option **will** **not** stop the job upon failure, while the explicit command **will** stop the job upon failure.
