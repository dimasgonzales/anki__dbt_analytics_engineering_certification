<front>

You updated a column description in a YAML file and ran a CI job. The job executed `dbt docs generate` successfully but failed during `dbt test`. Why is the new description not visible in the dbt Cloud documentation link?

<back>

Because the job did not complete successfully. dbt Cloud creates a 'staging' version of the docs during the run, but it only updates the live/default documentation view when the **entire job finishes with a Success status**.
