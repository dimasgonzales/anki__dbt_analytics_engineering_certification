<front>

You are writing a model that concatenates `first_name` and `last_name` with a space, but your company plans to migrate from Postgres to BigQuery soon. How should you write this logic to ensure it works on both platforms?

<back>

Use the `{{ dbt.concat() }}` macro. This generates the correct concatenation operator or function (e.g., `||` vs `CONCAT()`) depending on the target warehouse defined in your profile.

```sql
select
  {{ dbt.concat(['first_name', "' '", 'last_name']) }} as full_name
from {{ ref('users') }}
```
