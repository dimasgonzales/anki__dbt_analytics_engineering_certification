  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that configurations set via the `config()` macro have higher precedence than those in `dbt_project.yml`, directly supporting the answer's claim."

How does dbt determine configuration precedence between `dbt_project.yml` and the `config()` macro?

<back>

Configurations defined inside a model using the `{{ config() }}` macro take precedence over configurations defined in `dbt_project.yml`.

The hierarchy (from lowest to highest priority) is typically:
1. Default project config
2. `dbt_project.yml`
3. In-file `config()` macro
