  explanation: "The reference text discusses hierarchical configuration precedence and the principle that more specific configs take precedence, but it does not explicitly mention or compare the precedence between 'default project config', 'dbt_project.yml', and the 'config()' macro. The text focuses on configs within project files and installed packages, providing no direct evidence to verify the specific hierarchy stated in the answer."

<front>

How does dbt determine configuration precedence between `dbt_project.yml` and the `config()` macro?

</front>

<back>

Configurations defined inside a model using the `{{ config() }}` macro take precedence over configurations defined in `dbt_project.yml`.

The hierarchy (from lowest to highest priority) is typically:
1. Default project config
2. `dbt_project.yml`
3. In-file `config()` macro
