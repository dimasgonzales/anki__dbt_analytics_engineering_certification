  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that dbt Docs requires index.html, manifest.json, and catalog.json in the target/ directory to render a static website, aligning with the artifacts specified in the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "1. Copying the website `index.html` file into the `target/` directory. 2. Compiling the resources in your project, so that their `compiled_code` will be included in [`manifest.json`](/reference/artifacts/manifest-json). 3. Running queries against database metadata to produce the [`catalog.json`](/reference/artifacts/catalog-json) file."

What specific artifacts are required for dbt Docs to render a static website?

</front>

<back>

dbt Docs is a Single Page Application that relies principally on two JSON artifacts generated in the `target/` directory:
1. `manifest.json` (generated by `dbt compile` or `dbt run`)
2. `catalog.json` (generated by `dbt docs generate`)

Combined with `index.html`, these files allow the site to run without a backend server.
