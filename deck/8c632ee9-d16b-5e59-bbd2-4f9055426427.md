What specific artifacts are required for dbt Docs to render a static website?

</front>

<back>

dbt Docs is a Single Page Application that relies principally on two JSON artifacts generated in the `target/` directory:
1. `manifest.json` (generated by `dbt compile` or `dbt run`)
2. `catalog.json` (generated by `dbt docs generate`)

Combined with `index.html`, these files allow the site to run without a backend server.
