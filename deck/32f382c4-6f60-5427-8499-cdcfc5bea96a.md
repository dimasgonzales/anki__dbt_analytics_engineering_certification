What is the `state:modified` selector in dbt and what is its primary use case?

<back>

The `state:modified` selector is used to identify resources that have changed compared to a reference state (usually production artifacts). It is primarily used in **Slim CI** pipelines to only run models and tests that have been modified, saving time and compute resources.

Example:
```bash
dbt build --select state:modified --state path/to/artifacts
```
