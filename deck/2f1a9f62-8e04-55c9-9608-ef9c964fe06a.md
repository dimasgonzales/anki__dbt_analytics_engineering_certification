<front>

Which materialization types are supported for dbt Python models, and which common SQL materialization is explicitly unavailable?

<back>

Python models support `table` and `incremental` materializations. They *cannot* be materialized as `view` or `ephemeral` because Python code requires a runtime environment to execute and produce a DataFrame, which must then be persisted as a table.
