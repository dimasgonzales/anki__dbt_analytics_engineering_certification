  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that Python models do not support materializing as views, which aligns with part of the answer. However, it lacks information on whether table or incremental materializations are supported for Python models, and does not mention ephemeral materialization at all. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence in the provided text to verify the full answer."

<front>

Which materialization types are supported for dbt Python models, and which common SQL materialization is explicitly unavailable?

<back>

Python models support `table` and `incremental` materializations. They *cannot* be materialized as `view` or `ephemeral` because Python code requires a runtime environment to execute and produce a DataFrame, which must then be persisted as a table.
