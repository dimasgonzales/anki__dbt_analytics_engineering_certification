  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly describes a compilation error when the same test type is defined twice on the same column, directly supporting the answer that dbt raises a compilation error due to duplicate resource names."

    quote: "Compilation Error  dbt found two tests with the name \"accepted_values_orders_status__placed__shipped__completed__returned\" defined on column \"status\" in \"models.orders\". Since these resources have the same name, dbt will be unable to find the correct resource when running tests."

<front>

What happens if you define the same generic test type (e.g., `accepted_values`) twice on the same column without additional configuration?

<back>

dbt will raise a compilation error regarding a duplicate resource name. By default, dbt names tests based on the test type, model, and column name. Since these factors are identical, the generated names collide.
