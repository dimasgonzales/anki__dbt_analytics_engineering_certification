  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that ephemeral models are not built into the database and are interpolated as CTEs into dependent models, matching the answer."

<front>

How does dbt handle a model set to `materialized='ephemeral'` during compilation?

<back>

dbt interpolates the model's code as a **Common Table Expression (CTE)** into the SQL of any downstream models that reference it.

It does **not** create any physical object (table or view) in the database.
