<front>

You are building a foundational model in an upstream project that needs to be referenced by several downstream projects in a dbt Mesh architecture. How must you configure this model?

</front>

---

<back>

You must configure the model with `access: public` to allow cross-project referencing.

Example config:
```yaml
models:
  - name: dim_customers
    access: public
```
Without this explicit configuration, the model would default to `protected` and be invisible to downstream projects.

</back>
