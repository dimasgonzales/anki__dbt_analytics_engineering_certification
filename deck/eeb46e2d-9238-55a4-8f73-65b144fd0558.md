How can you configure a source such that dbt maps it to a different name than its original table name in your data warehouse?

<back>

The `identifier` config tells dbt what the physical source table's name is. By default, this is implicitly set to equal the source's `name` config (which is dbt's internal way of referring to the source). However, if you explicitly set the `identifier` config, you can make the `name` config anything you want, and then refer to the source by its `name` throughout your dbt code.  
  
Example:  

```
sources:
  - name: jaffle_shop
    tables:
      - name: orders
        identifier: api_orders
```  
The table shown above is called "api\_orders" in the database, but we can now refer to it as just "orders" in dbt.
