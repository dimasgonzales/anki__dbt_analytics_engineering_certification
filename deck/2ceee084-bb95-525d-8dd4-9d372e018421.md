  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly supports that incremental models are best used for very large datasets to reduce build time and cost, and that the initial run processes the full dataset similarly to a table materialization."
  citation:
    quote: "building the initial table on the full dataset is time consuming and equivalent to the table materialization."

Incremental models are best used for very large datasets (tables) to reduce build time and cost. The **initial** run acts exactly like a full `table` build (processing all history), while subsequent runs only transform new or changed records.
