<front>

Your CI/CD pipeline was recently updated to use a Python 3.12 image, but your project requires `dbt-core==1.6.0`. The installation step is now failing. What is the likely cause?

The likely cause is a compatibility mismatch. dbt Core v1.6 does not support Python 3.12 (support was added in v1.7). You must either downgrade the Python version in the CI/CD image or upgrade your project to a newer version of dbt Core.
