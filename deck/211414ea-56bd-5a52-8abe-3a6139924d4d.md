<front>

You are setting up a CI job that builds into a blank schema. Why would you use `dbt run --select @my_model` instead of `my_model+`?

</front>

<back>

`my_model+` only builds the model and its children. In a blank schema, the build will fail if those children rely on **other** parents that weren't selected.

The `@` operator ensures build completeness by including **all parents** of the downstream children, ensuring no `Relation not found` errors occur.
