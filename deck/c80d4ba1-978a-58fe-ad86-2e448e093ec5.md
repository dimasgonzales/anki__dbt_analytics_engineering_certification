<front>

You need to install a private package located at `github.com/org/private-repo` using a token stored in the environment variable `GIT_TOKEN`. How would you configure this in `packages.yml`?

Inject the environment variable into the Git URL string.

```yaml
packages:
  - git: "https://{{env_var('GIT_TOKEN')}}@github.com/org/private-repo.git"
    revision: main
```

</back>
