Can a dbt model be assigned to multiple groups? How do you configure a group assignment?

No, a model can belong to **only one** group. 

Group assignment is configured via the `group` config key, either in `dbt_project.yml` (for directories) or individual model configurations.
```yaml
models:
  - name: my_model
    config:
      group: marketing
```
