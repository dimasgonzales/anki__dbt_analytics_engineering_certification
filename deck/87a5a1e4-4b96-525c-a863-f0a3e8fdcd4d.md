<front>

You manage a contract-enforced model used by a dashboard. You need to change a column named `revenue` from `integer` to `numeric`. How will dbt view this change regarding governance?

dbt will detect this as a **breaking change**. Changing a `data_type` alters the contract terms, potentially breaking downstream dependencies (like dashboards or other models) that strictly expect an `integer` format.
