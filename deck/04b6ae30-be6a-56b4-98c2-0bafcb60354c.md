<front>

Your nightly `dbt build` fails on model 95 out of 100 due to a temporary connection issue. How do you finish the job efficiently without reprocessing the first 94 models?

<back>

```bash
dbt retry
```
This command reads the artifacts from the failed run and only processes the models that failed or were skipped, saving compute time and resources.
