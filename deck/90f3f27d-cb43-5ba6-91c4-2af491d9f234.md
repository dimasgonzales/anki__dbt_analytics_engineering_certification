  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text confirms that 'version:latest' is a valid selector for selecting latest versions, as shown in the example for 'dbt list'. However, it does not provide any information on combining this selector with a specific model name using a comma as an intersection operator, nor does it specify the exact syntax for 'dbt run' as given in the answer. No evidence supports or contradicts the claim about the comma operator."
