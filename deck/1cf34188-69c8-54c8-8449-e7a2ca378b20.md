<front>

What is the order of precedence (from highest to lowest) for dbt configurations defined in different locations?

<back>

The order of precedence is:
1. In-file `{{ config() }}` block (Highest)
2. Resource properties in a `.yml` file
3. Project-level configuration in `dbt_project.yml` (Lowest)

The most specific configuration always overrides the less specific ones.
