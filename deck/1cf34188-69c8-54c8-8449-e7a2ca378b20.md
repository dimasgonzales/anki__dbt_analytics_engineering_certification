  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states the order of precedence for dbt configurations, matching the answer's sequence and the principle that more specific configurations override less specific ones."

    quote: "Model configurations are applied hierarchically. You can configure models from within an installed package and also from within your dbt project in the following ways, listed in order of precedence: 1. Using a `config()` Jinja macro within a model. 2. Using a `config` resource property in a `.yml` file. 3. From the `dbt_project.yml` project file, under the `models:` key. The most specific configuration always takes precedence."

<front>

What is the order of precedence (from highest to lowest) for dbt configurations defined in different locations?

<back>

The order of precedence is:
1. In-file `{{ config() }}` block (Highest)
2. Resource properties in a `.yml` file
3. Project-level configuration in `dbt_project.yml` (Lowest)

The most specific configuration always overrides the less specific ones.
