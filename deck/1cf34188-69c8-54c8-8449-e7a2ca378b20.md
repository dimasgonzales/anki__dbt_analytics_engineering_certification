  explanation: "The reference text discusses general principles of configuration precedence in dbt, such as more specific configs overriding less specific ones and node-level configs clobbering project-level configs, but it does not explicitly state the order of precedence between the specific locations mentioned in the answer (in-file config() block, resource properties in .yml files, and project-level configuration in dbt_project.yml)."

<front>

What is the order of precedence (from highest to lowest) for dbt configurations defined in different locations?

</front>

<back>

The order of precedence is:
1. In-file `{{ config() }}` block (Highest)
2. Resource properties in a `.yml` file
3. Project-level configuration in `dbt_project.yml` (Lowest)

The most specific configuration always overrides the less specific ones.
