<front>

You have a large source table where running `select max(timestamp)` is too expensive, but you still need freshness alerts. How should you configure the source in YAML?

</front>

<back>

Define the `freshness` block but omit the `loaded_at_field` property. This forces dbt to use metadata to calculate freshness.

```yaml
sources:
  - name: my_source
    freshness:
      warn_after: {count: 12, period: hour}
    # loaded_at_field is omitted
```

</back>
