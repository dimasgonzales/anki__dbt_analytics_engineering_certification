<front>

Your project works locally but fails in dbt Cloud because it cannot find the seed files. You notice the config is `seed-paths: ["/Users/jdoe/dbt_project/seeds"]`. What is the issue?

<back>

The configuration uses an **absolute path**, which relies on the specific local file system structure. You must change it to a **relative path** to ensure portability across environments.

**Correction:**
```yaml
seed-paths: ["seeds"]
```
