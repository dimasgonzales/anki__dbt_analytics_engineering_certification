<front>

You are creating a base model `base_users` containing PII that should only be transformed by other models in the 'identity' group. How do you enforce this restriction in the schema YAML?

</front>

<back>

Configure the model with both the `group` and `access` keys under the `config` block to restrict consumption.

```yaml
models:
  - name: base_users
    config:
      group: identity
      access: private
```

</back>
