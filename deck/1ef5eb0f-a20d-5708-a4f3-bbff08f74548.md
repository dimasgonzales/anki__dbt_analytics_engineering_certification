  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that dbt compile requires a data platform connection for introspective queries to gather necessary information, which directly supports the answer's claim about database introspection."

<back>

`dbt compile` is not an offline operation because it requires database introspection. It connects to the warehouse to populate the relation cache and retrieve metadata needed to resolve logic like `adapter.get_columns_in_relation` or incremental model behaviors.
