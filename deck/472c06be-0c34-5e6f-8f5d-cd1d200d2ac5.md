What are the three possible exit codes dbt can return, and what do they mean?

<back>

- **0**: dbt completed without error
- **1**: dbt completed with at least one *handled* error (e.g. model syntax error, bad permissions). The run completed, but some models may have been skipped.
- **2:** dbt completed with an *unhandled* error (e.g. ctrl-c, network interruption)
