  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that when an upstream test fails during 'dbt build', downstream resources are skipped to prevent further processing, aligning with the answer's claim."
  citation:
    quote: "Tests on upstream resources will block downstream resources from running, and a test failure will cause those downstream resources to skip entirely. E.g. If `model_b` depends on `model_a`, and a `unique` test on `model_a` fails, then `model_b` will `SKIP`."

<front>

When using `dbt build`, what happens to downstream models if an upstream resource fails a test?

</front>

<back>

dbt halts the lineage branch and marks all downstream resources as `SKIP`.

This prevents cascading failures and ensures that potentially invalid data does not propagate to downstream models.
