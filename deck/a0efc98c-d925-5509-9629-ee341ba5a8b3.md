<front>

You need to make every model in the `marts/finance` directory `public` for cross-project access, without editing every individual model file. How do you achieve this?

<back>

Configure the `+access` property within your `dbt_project.yml` file under the specific folder hierarchy.

```yaml
models:
  my_project:
    marts:
      finance:
        +access: public
```

</back>
