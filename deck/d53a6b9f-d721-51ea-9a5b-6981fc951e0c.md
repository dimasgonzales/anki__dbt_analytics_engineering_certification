  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that native integrations (GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps) support automated workflows including CI builds on pull requests, and that Git clone methods require API usage for CI triggers, lacking native UI support."

Which git connection types in dbt Cloud support native 'Run on Pull Request' CI triggers?

<back>

Native integrations only (**GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps**). Generic 'Git clone' connections do not support native automated CI triggers within the dbt Cloud UI settings.
