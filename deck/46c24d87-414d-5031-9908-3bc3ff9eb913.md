<front>

You are reviewing a Pull Request and notice thousands of lines of code added under the `dbt_packages/` directory. What feedback should you give the developer?

</front>

---

<back>

Advise the developer to remove the `dbt_packages/` directory from the commit and add it to the `.gitignore` file.

Example `.gitignore`:
```text
dbt_packages/
target/
logs/
```
These files should be generated by the CI/CD pipeline using `dbt deps`, not hardcoded into the repo.
