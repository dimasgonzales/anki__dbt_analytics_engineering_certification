<front>

You are creating a documentation file `docs/revenue.md`. You need to create a reusable block named `mrr_calculation` containing a formula explanation. How would you write this?

</front>

<back>

Wrap the formula explanation text in the docs block tags within the markdown file.

Code:
```markdown
{% docs mrr_calculation %}
MRR is calculated by summing the monthly cost of all active subscriptions.
{% enddocs %}
```

</back>
