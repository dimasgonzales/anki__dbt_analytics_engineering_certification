<front>

You are defining an exposure for a reverse ETL sync and set the property `type: reverse_etl` in the YAML file, but `dbt parse` fails. What is the cause?

<back>

The `type` property enforces validation against a specific list of allowed strings: `dashboard`, `notebook`, `analysis`, `ml`, or `application`. Since `reverse_etl` is not a valid option, you should likely categorize it as an `application` to pass validation.
