  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text discusses snapshot meta-fields and mentions `dbt_valid_to` and `dbt_is_deleted`, but it does not explicitly list or confirm the three specific fields `dbt_scd_id`, `dbt_valid_from`, and `dbt_valid_to` as stated in the answer. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to verify the answer."

<front>

Which three specific system-generated meta-fields does dbt add to a table to distinguish it as a valid snapshot?

</front>

<back>

dbt adds the following columns to track SCD Type 2 history:

1. `dbt_scd_id`: Unique ID for the snapshot record
2. `dbt_valid_from`: Timestamp when the row became valid
3. `dbt_valid_to`: Timestamp when the row became invalid (or null if current)

</back>
