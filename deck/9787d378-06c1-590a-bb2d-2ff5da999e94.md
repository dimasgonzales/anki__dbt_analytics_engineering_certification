  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that the `--warn-error` flag treats all warnings as errors, matching the flashcard's main claim about its function. The specific examples and environment variable mention are consistent with the general behavior described."
  citation:
    quote: "Using the `--warn-error` flag or `--warn-error-options '{\"error\": \"all\"}'` will treat *all* current and future warnings as errors."

<front>

What is the function of the `--warn-error` flag in a dbt invocation?

</front>

---

<back>

The `--warn-error` flag (or `DBT_WARN_ERROR` environment variable) converts **all** warnings into runtime errors. This causes the dbt command to fail immediately if it encounters deprecation warnings, tests with 'warn' severity, or empty selection results.
