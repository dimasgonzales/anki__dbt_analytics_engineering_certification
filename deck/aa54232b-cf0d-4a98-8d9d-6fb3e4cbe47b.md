<front>
What is the difference between checking the "run source freshness" box in the job creation UI vs. actually executing the `dbt source freshness` command as part of the job?

The freshness check resulting from selecting the UI option **will** **not** stop the job upon failure, while the explicit command **will** stop the job upon failure.
