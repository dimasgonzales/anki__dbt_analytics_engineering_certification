  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly states that the `builtins` variable provides access to native dbt methods (ref, source, config) even when they are masked by custom macros, which directly supports the core claim in the answer. The additional claim about avoiding infinite recursion when overriding core functionality is a logical implication but not explicitly stated in the text."

    quote: "The `builtins` variable exists to provide references to builtin dbt context methods. This allows macros to be created with names that *mask* dbt builtin context methods, while still making those methods accessible in the dbt compilation context."

What is the purpose of the `builtins` variable when writing dbt macros?

<back>

The `builtins` variable provides access to native dbt methods (`ref`, `source`, `config`) even when they have been masked by custom macros. This is essential for avoiding infinite recursion when overriding core functionality.
