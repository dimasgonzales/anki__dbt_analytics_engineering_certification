  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly supports that the builtins variable provides access to ref, source, and config methods when masked by custom macros, but it does not mention or support the claim that it is essential for avoiding infinite recursion when overriding core functionality."
  citation:
    quote: "The `builtins` variable exists to provide references to builtin dbt context methods. This allows macros to be created with names that *mask* dbt builtin context methods, while still making those methods accessible in the dbt compilation context. The `builtins` variable is a dictionary containing the following keys: ref, source, config."

What is the purpose of the `builtins` variable when writing dbt macros?

<back>

The `builtins` variable provides access to native dbt methods (`ref`, `source`, `config`) even when they have been masked by custom macros. This is essential for avoiding infinite recursion when overriding core functionality.
