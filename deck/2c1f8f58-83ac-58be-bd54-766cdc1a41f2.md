<front>

What configuration key is used to specify the execution strategy (such as using a specific cluster or execution engine like BigQuery DataFrames) for a dbt Python model?

The `submission_method` configuration key. This tells the adapter how to submit the Python code for execution on the data platform.

```python
dbt.config(submission_method="bigframes")
```
