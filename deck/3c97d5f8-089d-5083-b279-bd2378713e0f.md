<front>

How can you override a default adapter macro (such as the one controlling seed batch sizes) in your dbt project?

<back>

Define a macro in your project's `macros` directory with the exact name of the adapter macro, including the adapter prefix (e.g., `redshift__get_batch_size`). dbt's dispatch order prioritizes macros defined in the local project over the default adapter implementation.
