  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly demonstrates overriding a default adapter macro by defining a macro with the exact name including the adapter prefix in the project's macros directory, aligning with the answer's method."
  citation:
    quote: "For the `dbt-trino` adapter, the macro for batch size is `trino__get_batch_size()` and its default value is `1000`. To change this default behavior, you can add this macro to your dbt project:"

<front>

How can you override a default adapter macro (such as the one controlling seed batch sizes) in your dbt project?

<back>

Define a macro in your project's `macros` directory with the exact name of the adapter macro, including the adapter prefix (e.g., `redshift__get_batch_size`). dbt's dispatch order prioritizes macros defined in the local project over the default adapter implementation.
