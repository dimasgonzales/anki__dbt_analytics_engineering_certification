When orchestrating dbt Core versus dbt Cloud, how does the handling of the execution environment differ?

In **dbt Core**, the orchestrator (e.g., Airflow) must explicitly manage the Python environment, dependency installation, and secrets (often using Docker containers). 

In **dbt Cloud**, these concerns are abstracted; the orchestrator triggers a Job ID via an API, and dbt Cloud manages the execution environment and secrets internally.
