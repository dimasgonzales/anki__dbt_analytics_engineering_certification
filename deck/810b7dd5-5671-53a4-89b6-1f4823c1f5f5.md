  explanation: "The reference text does not address the specific differences in execution environment handling during orchestration between dbt Core and dbt Cloud. It mentions orchestration setup but lacks details on Python environment management, dependency installation, secrets, API triggers, or internal environment management as described in the answer."

<front>

When orchestrating dbt Core versus dbt Cloud, how does the handling of the execution environment differ?

<back>

In **dbt Core**, the orchestrator (e.g., Airflow) must explicitly manage the Python environment, dependency installation, and secrets (often using Docker containers). 

In **dbt Cloud**, these concerns are abstracted; the orchestrator triggers a Job ID via an API, and dbt Cloud manages the execution environment and secrets internally.
