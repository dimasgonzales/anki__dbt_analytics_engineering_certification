<front>

You have a model `orders` with versions `v: 1` and `v: 2` defined in YAML. No `latest_version` is specified. 

How would you reference version 1 explicitly, and what does `{{ ref('orders') }}` resolve to?

</front>

<back>

To reference version 1 explicitly, pass the version argument:
```sql
select * from {{ ref('orders', version=1) }}
```

`{{ ref('orders') }}` will automatically resolve to **v2** because it is the highest version identifier and no specific `latest_version` was configured.
