<front>

You run the following command in a CI pipeline, but it fails with a manifest parsing error:
```bash
dbt run --select state:modified --defer --state path/to/prod_artifacts
```
Your CI environment has been upgraded to a newer dbt version, but Production is still on an older version. What is the cause?

<back>

The failure is caused by **Manifest Incompatibility**. 

The CI environment (newer version) produces a different manifest schema than the Production artifacts (older version). When dbt tries to compare the states for `state:modified` or deferral, the version mismatch prevents proper parsing of the production state.
