<front>

What is the purpose of the `--exclude` flag in dbt commands, and what syntax does it accept?

</front>

<back>

The `--exclude` flag removes specific resources from the list of models dbt intends to run. It accepts the **exact same selector syntax** as the `--select` flag, including graph operators (`+`, `@`) and set operations (intersections/unions).
