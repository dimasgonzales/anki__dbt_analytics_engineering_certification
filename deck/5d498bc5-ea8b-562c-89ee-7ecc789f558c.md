  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The quote explicitly mentions `--exclude` as an argument used alongside `--select` for resource selection in dbt tasks, supporting the purpose of removing specific resources. The reference text also includes examples in the first source showing `--exclude` in action, such as 'dbt test --exclude \"not_null_orders_order_id\"', which aligns with the answer's claim about excluding resources. While the syntax details like graph operators are not explicitly detailed for `--exclude`, the text implies it uses the same selection syntax as `--select` by grouping them together, and the `dbt ls` command supports all selection syntax arguments, reinforcing consistency."

    quote: "Note that the following arguments (`--select`, `--exclude`, and `--selector`) also apply to other dbt tasks, such as `test` and `build`."

<front>

What is the purpose of the `--exclude` flag in dbt commands, and what syntax does it accept?

<back>

The `--exclude` flag removes specific resources from the list of models dbt intends to run. It accepts the **exact same selector syntax** as the `--select` flag, including graph operators (`+`, `@`) and set operations (intersections/unions).
