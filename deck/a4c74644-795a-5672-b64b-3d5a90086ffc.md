<front>

A BI dashboard connected to a dbt model is timing out because the query takes too long to execute. The model is currently defined as a view. How should you resolve this performance issue?

Change the materialization to `table`. This shifts the compute cost to the build phase, pre-calculating the data so the dashboard can query the physical table instantly without re-running the transformation logic.

```sql
{{ config(materialized='table') }}
```
