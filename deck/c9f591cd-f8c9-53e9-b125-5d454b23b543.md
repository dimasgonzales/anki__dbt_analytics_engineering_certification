<front>

You just cloned a colleague's dbt repo and see a `packages.yml` file, but the `dbt_packages` directory is missing. What must you do before you can run the models?

<back>

You must run `dbt deps`.

Because package directories are usually git-ignored, they do not exist in a fresh clone. `dbt deps` reads the `packages.yml` file and installs the necessary dependencies into the project structure.
