<front>

You added a new column `region_id` to an existing seed file `office_locations.csv`. When running `dbt seed`, you get a database error. How do you resolve this?

Run the seed command with the full-refresh flag to force dbt to drop the existing table and recreate it with the new column structure:

```bash
dbt seed --full-refresh
```
