<front>

You are building a custom materialization that performs an `INSERT OVERWRITE`. It absolutely requires the user to specify a `partition_by` field in their model config to work safely. How do you enforce this?

</front>

<back>

Use `config.require` at the top of your materialization block:

```jinja
{% set partition_col = config.require('partition_by') %}
```
This ensures dbt halts execution with an error if the user tries to run a model without defining the `partition_by` config.
