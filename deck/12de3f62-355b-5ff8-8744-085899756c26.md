<front>

You are modeling a massive, immutable event log that contains billions of rows. The default `merge` strategy is too slow and expensive. How should you optimize the incremental load?

Switch to `incremental_strategy = 'insert_overwrite'`. Since the data is immutable (no updates needed), replacing partitions is significantly faster and cheaper than the `merge` strategy, which requires scanning for unique keys to update rows.
