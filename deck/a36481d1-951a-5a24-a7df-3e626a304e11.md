  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly describes that the `--defer` flag uses a state manifest (such as from production) to resolve ref calls for nodes not selected in the current run, enabling building specific models without constructing their upstream dependencies first, which directly supports the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "In most cases, you will want to use the same state for both: compare logical changes against production, and also \"fail over\" to the production environment for unbuilt upstream resources."

<front>

What is the primary purpose of the `--defer` flag in dbt?

<back>

The `--defer` flag allows dbt to reference production artifacts (manifests) for upstream models that are not part of the current run. This enables you to build specific models in a development or CI environment without needing to build their entire upstream lineage first.
