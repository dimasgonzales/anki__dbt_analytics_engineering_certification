  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly states that using the '|' character in YAML descriptions maintains line breaks and allows Markdown formatting, which directly supports the Answer's claim."

    quote: "Split your description over multiple lines using `|`. Interior line breaks are maintained and Markdown can be used. This method is recommended for more complex descriptions:"
