<front>

You have `+materialized: table` set for a directory in `dbt_project.yml`. Inside a specific model within that directory, you include the following code:

```sql
{{ config(materialized='view') }}
select ...
```

How will dbt build this model?

</front>

<back>

dbt will build the model as a **view**. Since configurations are applied hierarchically, the specific in-file configuration overrides the general directory configuration found in `dbt_project.yml`.
