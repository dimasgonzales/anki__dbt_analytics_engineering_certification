<front>

Which configuration key in `dbt_project.yml` allows you to change the default directory where external packages are installed?

You use the `packages-install-path` configuration key.

Example:
```yaml
name: my_project
packages-install-path: "libraries" 
```
This overrides the default behavior to store packages in a custom folder.
