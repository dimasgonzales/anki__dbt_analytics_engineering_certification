  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that when a model attempts to reference another model outside its allowed access, dbt raises a DbtReferenceError, which directly matches the scenario described in the question about parsing errors for access violations in `ref()` calls."
  citation:
    quote: "dbt.exceptions.DbtReferenceError: Parsing Error   Node model.jaffle_shop.marketing_model attempted to reference node model.jaffle_shop.finance_model,    which is not allowed because the referenced node is private to the finance group."

<front>

What specific error type does dbt raise during parsing if a model attempts to `ref()` a node that violates access restrictions?

</front>

<back>

dbt raises a `DbtReferenceError`. 

This error occurs at parse/compile time when dbt detects that a reference exists between two nodes (like a model referencing a private model in a different group) that is not permitted by the configured access levels.
