<front>

What specific error type does dbt raise during parsing if a model attempts to `ref()` a node that violates access restrictions?

</front>

<back>

dbt raises a `DbtReferenceError`. 

This error occurs at parse/compile time when dbt detects that a reference exists between two nodes (like a model referencing a private model in a different group) that is not permitted by the configured access levels.
