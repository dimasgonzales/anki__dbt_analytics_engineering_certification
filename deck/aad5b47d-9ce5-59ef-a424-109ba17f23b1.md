  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that the log function can be used to print objects to the command line, which directly supports the answer's core claim about using the log function for CLI output during a dbt run. However, the specific mention of the 'info=True' argument is not found in the provided text."

What Jinja function is used to print the value of a variable to the CLI standard output during a dbt run?

<back>

The `log` function is used with the `info` argument set to `True`.

Example:
```jinja
{{ log(variable_name, info=True) }}
```
