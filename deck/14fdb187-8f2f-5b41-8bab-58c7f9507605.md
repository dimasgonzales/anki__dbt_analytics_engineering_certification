  explanation: "The reference text partially supports the answer by recommending starting with views and moving to tables for performance reasons, but it does not contain information about a progression to incremental models when tables become slow to build. Specifically, the text does not mention 'dashboard latency', 'pipeline latency', or a 'Golden Rule' progression to incremental models."

<front>

What is the standard progression (the 'Golden Rule') for optimizing model materialization based on performance bottlenecks?

1. **View**: Start here by default.
2. **Table**: Move to this if the view becomes too slow to *query* (dashboard latency).
3. **Incremental**: Move to this if the table becomes too slow to *build* (pipeline latency).
