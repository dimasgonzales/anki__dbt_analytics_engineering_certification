<front>

You need to run only modified models based on a comparison with a local feature branch artifact, but you want to defer unselected upstream references to production data. How do you configure this?

You should use split state flags: `--state` for the logical comparison and `--defer-state` for the production pointer.

Example:
```bash
dbt run --select state:modified --state path/to/feature_branch --defer --defer-state path/to/prod_manifest
```

</back>
