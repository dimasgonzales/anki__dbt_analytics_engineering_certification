<front>

What is the primary performance drawback of using `ephemeral` materialization on very large datasets?

</front>

<back>

`ephemeral` models are interpolated as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), which run in-memory. On very large datasets, this often causes memory bottlenecks (spilling to disk) and significantly increases query compilation and execution time compared to physically persisted tables.
