<front>

You have a model named `stg_customers` that selects directly from `raw.jaffle_shop.customers` using SQL, not Jinja. You run `dbt run -s source:jaffle_shop+`. Why does `stg_customers` fail to run?

</front>

<back>

Because you hardcoded the SQL, dbt cannot detect the dependency between the source and the model. The `stg_customers` node is not connected to the source in the DAG, so the selector `source:jaffle_shop+` (which selects the source and its children) does not identify `stg_customers` as a downstream dependent.
