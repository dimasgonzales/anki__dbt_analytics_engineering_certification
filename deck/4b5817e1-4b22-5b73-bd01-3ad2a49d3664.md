<front>

Your CI/CD pipeline must fail if *any* data test issues are found, even if the test is configured to only "warn" on failure. How do you achieve this?

<back>

Execute the test command with the `--warn-error` flag:

```bash
dbt test --warn-error
```
This forces dbt to exit with a non-zero status code if any warnings occur.
