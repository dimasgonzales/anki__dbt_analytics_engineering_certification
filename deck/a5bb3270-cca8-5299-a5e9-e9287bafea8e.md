What is the primary difference in execution logic between `dbt build` and running separate commands like `dbt run` followed by `dbt test`?

`dbt build` executes resources (models, seeds, tests, snapshots) in strict DAG dependency order, resource-by-resource. Unlike `dbt run && dbt test` (which runs all models then all tests), `dbt build` runs a model, then immediately runs its tests. If a test fails, dbt skips downstream dependencies, ensuring fail-fast behavior.
