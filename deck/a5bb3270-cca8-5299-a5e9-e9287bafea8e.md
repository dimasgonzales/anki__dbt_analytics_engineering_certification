  explanation: "The Reference Text mentions `dbt build` can run commands in a specified order and discusses fail-fast behavior for source testing, but it does not explicitly confirm the execution logic described in the Answer, such as running models and tests immediately in strict DAG order or skipping downstream dependencies upon test failure. Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the answer."

<front>

What is the primary difference in execution logic between `dbt build` and running separate commands like `dbt run` followed by `dbt test`?

<back>

`dbt build` executes resources (models, seeds, tests, snapshots) in strict DAG dependency order, resource-by-resource. Unlike `dbt run && dbt test` (which runs all models then all tests), `dbt build` runs a model, then immediately runs its tests. If a test fails, dbt skips downstream dependencies, ensuring fail-fast behavior.
