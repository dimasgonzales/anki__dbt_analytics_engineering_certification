  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer accurately describes indirect selection in dbt test, where selecting models runs tests that depend on them, with the default eager mode and the cautious option. The reference text confirms that tests can be selected indirectly by including their parents, provides examples for cautious mode, and mentions eager as the default, aligning with the answer. However, the note on test exclusion being greedy is not addressed in the provided text."

<front>

how does "indirect selection" work for the `dbt test` command?

<back>

Selecting a set of models with the `dbt test` command will implicitly run any tests that depend on those models. E.g. `dbt test --select customers` will run tests that are defined on that model, without selecting the tests themselves directly.   
  
By default, indirect selection is **eager**, meaning *any* test downstream of the selected model(s) will be run, even if those tests also depend on other models that aren't selected. This behavior can be changed by setting the `--indirect-selection=cautious` option, which will prevent tests from running unless *all* of their model dependencies are included in the selection.  
  
Note that test *exclusion* is always greedy; if *any* parent is explicitly excluded, the test will be excluded as well.
