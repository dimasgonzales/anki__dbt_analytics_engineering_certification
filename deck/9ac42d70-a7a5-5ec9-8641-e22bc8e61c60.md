Which two JSON artifacts are most critical for dbt's state comparison and documentation features?

<back>

1. **`manifest.json`**: Contains the full structure of the project (models, config, lineage).
2. **`run_results.json`**: Contains the results, timing, and status of the most recent execution.

These are stored in the `target/` directory by default.
