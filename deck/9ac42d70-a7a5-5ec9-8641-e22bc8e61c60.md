  explanation: "The reference text mentions dbt artifacts and state comparison, but does not explicitly identify `manifest.json` and `run_results.json` as the two most critical JSON artifacts for state comparison and documentation features. While `run_results` is referenced indirectly and state comparison is discussed, the specific artifacts in the answer are not directly supported or contradicted by the provided text."

<front>

Which two JSON artifacts are most critical for dbt's state comparison and documentation features?

</front>

<back>

1. **`manifest.json`**: Contains the full structure of the project (models, config, lineage).
2. **`run_results.json`**: Contains the results, timing, and status of the most recent execution.

These are stored in the `target/` directory by default.
