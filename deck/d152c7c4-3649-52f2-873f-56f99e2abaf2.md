<front>

You have `severity: error` defined for all tests in `dbt_project.yml`, but a specific model's `unique` test has the following configuration in its schema YAML:
```yaml
data_tests:
  - unique:
      config:
        severity: warn
```
What will be the severity of this test when executed?

</front>

<back>

The test will execute with **severity: warn**.

Configurations defined in the specific test instance in the YAML file take precedence over project-level defaults defined in `dbt_project.yml`.
