<front>

You need to ensure the `location_id` column in your `warehouse` seed is created as an `integer` and `zipcode` as `varchar(5)`. How would you configure this in YAML?

</front>

<back>

Define the types under the `+column_types` key for that specific seed:
```yaml
warehouse:
  +column_types:
    location_id: integer
    zipcode: varchar(5)
```

</back>
