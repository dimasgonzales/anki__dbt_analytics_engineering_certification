<front>

What feature does dbt Cloud use to ensure that Continuous Integration (CI) tests run in isolation without overwriting production data?

<back>

dbt Cloud uses **temporary schemas** (often named `dbt_cloud_pr_<job_id>_<pr_id>`) for CI runs.

When the CI job finishes (pass or fail), dbt automatically drops this schema to keep the data warehouse clean.
