  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly confirms that analyses support the use of `{{ ref(...) }}` functionality in dbt."
  citation:
    quote: "Any .sql files found in the analyses/ directory of a dbt project will be compiled, but not executed. This means that analysts can use dbt functionality like {{ ref(...) }} to select from models in an environment-agnostic way."

Does the `analyses/` directory support the use of the `{{ ref() }}` function?

Yes. Even though they are not materialized, analyses support full Jinja functionality, including `{{ ref() }}`, `{{ source() }}`, and macros. This ensures dependencies are resolved correctly based on the current environment configuration.
