  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly lists the four modes as eager, cautious, buildable, and empty, with eager identified as the default. It also describes eager as selecting tests if any parent is selected and cautious as not including tests if they have unselected parents, which aligns with the Answer's descriptions."
  citation:
    quote: "As a general rule, dbt will indirectly select *all* tests if they touch *any* resource that you're selecting directly. We call this 'eager' indirect selection. You can optionally switch the indirect selection mode to 'cautious', 'buildable', or 'empty' by setting `indirect_selection` for a specific criterion:"

<front>

What are the four available modes for the `--indirect-selection` flag in dbt, and which is the default?

<back>

The four modes are `eager` (default), `cautious`, `buildable`, and `empty`. `eager` runs tests if *any* parent is selected, whereas `cautious` requires *all* parents to be selected.
