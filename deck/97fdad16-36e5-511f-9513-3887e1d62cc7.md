  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that in dbt, more specific configurations take precedence over less specific ones, using hierarchical scoping. This directly supports the answer's claim that configurations for specific subdirectories or individual seeds override project-level settings."

<front>

How does dbt determine precedence when a seed configuration is defined at both the project level (global) and a subdirectory level?

<back>

dbt follows a hierarchical scoping rule where more specific configurations override general ones. A configuration defined for a specific subdirectory or individual seed takes precedence over the default configuration set at the project root level.
