  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that for the Developer role, the new default is read access, and write access must be specified, which directly supports the answer's claim about default read-only access and the need for explicit write access."

<back>

The 'Developer' role defaults to **read-only** access for environments. To allow actions like triggering jobs, **Write** access must be explicitly granted for specific environment types (e.g., Development or General) in the user or group configuration.
