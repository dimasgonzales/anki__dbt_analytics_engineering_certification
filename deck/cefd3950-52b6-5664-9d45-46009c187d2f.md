How does preserving data types in macro returns facilitate Dynamic SQL generation in dbt models?

It allows the calling model to immediately use the returned value in control structures like `{% for %}` loops or `{% if %}` statements.

For example, a macro can return a list of columns, and the model can loop through that list to generate a `SELECT` statement without needing to parse a string first.
