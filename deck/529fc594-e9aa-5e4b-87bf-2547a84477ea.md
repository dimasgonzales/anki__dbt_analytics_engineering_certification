<front>

In dbt Cloud, how does the failure behavior differ between the 'Run source freshness' UI checkbox and adding `dbt source freshness` as a manual command step?

The **UI checkbox** is a "soft" step; if freshness fails, the job continues to the next steps (like `dbt build`) and may still result in a Success status.

Adding `dbt source freshness` as a **manual command step** causes a "hard" failure; if the command returns a non-zero exit code (fails), the job halts immediately and the run status is marked as Error.
