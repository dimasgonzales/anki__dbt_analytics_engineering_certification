  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly supports the answer. For the UI checkbox, selectors/rank_4.md states that failure does not necessarily fail the job, allowing it to succeed if subsequent steps pass. For manual command steps, deployment-jobs/rank_1.md indicates that if any run step fails, the entire job fails with an error status, which applies to commands like 'dbt source freshness' added manually."
  citation:
    quote: "Job outcome Source freshness checkbox — dbt executes the `dbt source freshness` command as the first run step in your job. If that particular run step in your job fails, the job can still succeed if all subsequent run steps are successful."

In dbt Cloud, how does the failure behavior differ between the 'Run source freshness' UI checkbox and adding `dbt source freshness` as a manual command step?

The **UI checkbox** is a "soft" step; if freshness fails, the job continues to the next steps (like `dbt build`) and may still result in a Success status.

Adding `dbt source freshness` as a **manual command step** causes a "hard" failure; if the command returns a non-zero exit code (fails), the job halts immediately and the run status is marked as Error.
