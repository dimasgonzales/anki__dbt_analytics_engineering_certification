  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The Reference Text provides evidence that dbt uses the `ref` function to define dependencies and construct the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), as stated in the Answer. However, the Answer also mentions the `source()` function and parsing for seeds, which are not addressed in the provided text. Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the complete answer."

<front>

How does dbt determine the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and dependencies between models?

<back>

dbt parses the project's SQL files and looks for calls to the `ref()` function (for models/seeds) and `source()` function. It uses these references to construct the dependency graph, determining the order in which models must be executed.
