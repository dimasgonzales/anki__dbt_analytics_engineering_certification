  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer correctly states that `fail_calc` allows specifying a custom calculation for failing test queries and defaults to COUNT(*), which is explicitly confirmed in the reference text."
  citation:
    quote: "Most often, this is the count of rows returned by the test query: the default value of `fail_calc` is `count(*)`. But it can also be a custom calculation, whether an aggregate calculation or simply the name of a column to be selected from the test query."
