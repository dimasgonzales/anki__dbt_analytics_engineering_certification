<front>

What is the recommended direction of data flow in a dbt DAG, and which layers are typically involved?

<back>

The DAG should flow from left to right, starting with raw data and ending with business metrics.

The standard layering approach is:
**Sources** -> **Staging** (cleaning) -> **Intermediate** (logic/joins) -> **Marts** (final entities/facts).
