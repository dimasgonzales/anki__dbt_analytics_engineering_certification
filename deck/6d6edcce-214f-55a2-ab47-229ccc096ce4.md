<front>

What specific selector syntax is used in dbt to run only the models that failed in a previous run, along with their downstream dependencies?

You use the `result:error+` selector. 

`result:error` selects the models that had a status of 'error' in the state run, and the `+` appends all downstream dependencies of those failed models.
