<front>

You are designing the `marts` layer for a BI dashboard. The stakeholders require sub-second query response times, but the data volume is small enough that build time is not a concern. Which materialization should you choose?

<back>

Use `table` materialization.

```yaml
{{ config(materialized='table') }}
```

Tables physically store the data, offering the fastest query performance for BI tools compared to views, which must execute the underlying logic at query time.
