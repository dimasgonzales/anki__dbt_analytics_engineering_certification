  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer states that exposures enable integrated orchestration by automatically triggering downstream asset refreshes after dbt jobs succeed. This is supported by the reference text, which explicitly mentions that exposures proactively refresh data sources during scheduled dbt jobs, ensuring BI tools have up-to-date data without manual intervention, aligning with the concept of data freshness in deployment."

<front>

How do exposures relate to **Data Freshness** in a deployment context?

<back>

Exposures allow for **integrated orchestration**. By defining the relationship between dbt models and downstream tools, orchestration platforms (like dbt Cloud) can automatically trigger a refresh of the downstream asset (e.g., a Tableau extract) immediately after the dbt job succeeds.
