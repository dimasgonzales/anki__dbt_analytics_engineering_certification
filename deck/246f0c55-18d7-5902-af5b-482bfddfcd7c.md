<front>

A developer clones a dbt repo but cannot run the project, receiving an error: `Profile 'analytics' not found`. They see `profile: 'analytics'` inside `dbt_project.yml`. What is the likely cause?

<back>

The `profile` key in `dbt_project.yml` tells dbt which configuration group to look for within `profiles.yml` to establish a database connection.
