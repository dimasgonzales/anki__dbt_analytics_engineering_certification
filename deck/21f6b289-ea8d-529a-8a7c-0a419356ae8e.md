  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer accurately describes the general behavior where lower-level configs overwrite higher-level ones, and the three exceptions listed (tags additive, meta dictionaries merged with key-level precedence, pre-hook and post-hook additive) are explicitly supported by the reference text. The text also mentions 'freshness' as another exception, but this does not contradict the answer's claims."

Note that a few configs have different merge behavior: * [`tags`](/reference/resource-configs/tags) are additive. If a model has some tags configured in `dbt_project.yml`, and more tags are applied in its `.sql` file, the final set of tags will include all of them. * [`meta`](/reference/resource-configs/meta) dictionaries are merged (a more specific key-value pair replaces a less specific value with the same key). * [`pre-hook` and `post-hook`](/reference/resource-configs/pre-hook-post-hook) are also additive."

<front>

When the same config is set multiple times at different hierarchical "levels", what *usually* happens? What are some exceptions to this default behavior?

<back>

In most cases, a config value at a lower/more specific "level" will completely overwrite the config value from a higher/less specific "level". There are three notable exceptions:  

- **tags** are additive. E.g. tags defined within a resource YAML file are *added to*tags defined in `dbt_project.yml` that cover the same resource.
- **meta dictionaries** are merged, though if the exact same dictionary *key* is present at multiple levels, the key-value pair from the most specific level will win out.
- **pre-hook** and **post-hook** behaviours are also additive
