<front>

When the same config is set multiple times at different hierarchical "levels", what *usually* happens? What are some exceptions to this default behavior?

<back>

In most cases, a config value at a lower/more specific "level" will completely overwrite the config value from a higher/less specific "level". There are three notable exceptions:  

- **tags** are additive. E.g. tags defined within a resource YAML file are *added to*tags defined in `dbt_project.yml` that cover the same resource.
- **meta dictionaries** are merged, though if the exact same dictionary *key* is present at multiple levels, the key-value pair from the most specific level will win out.
- **pre-hook** and **post-hook** behaviours are also additive
