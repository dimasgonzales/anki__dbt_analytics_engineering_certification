<front>

Why must you specify a context, such as an `environmentId`, when querying dbt lineage metadata?

Because lineage is **environment-specific**.

Configurations, materialization strategies, and available resources often differ between environments (e.g., Development vs. Production). Specifying the environment ensures you retrieve the metadata accurately reflecting that specific deployment.
