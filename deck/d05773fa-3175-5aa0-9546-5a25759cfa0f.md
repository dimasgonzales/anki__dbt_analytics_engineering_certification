  explanation: "The Reference Text indicates that 'generate_schema_name' has a limited Jinja context but does not mention the 'run_query()' macro or the distinction between parsing/compilation and run phases, so there is insufficient evidence to verify the answer."

<front>

Why can't you use the results of a `run_query()` macro inside `generate_schema_name`?

<back>

The `generate_schema_name` macro runs during the **parsing/compilation** phase to determine the project structure.

Database connections and query execution happen in the **run** phase, so query results are not yet available in the Jinja context.
