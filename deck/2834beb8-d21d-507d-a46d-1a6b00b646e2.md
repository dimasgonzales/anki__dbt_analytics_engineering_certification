  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text only confirms that production jobs can update the Catalog when running dbt run or dbt build, but it does not mention Staging, Development, or CI environments. Therefore, the claims about these specific environments cannot be verified from the provided evidence."
  citation:
    quote: "If you use Catalog and run production jobs with an external orchestrator, ensure your production jobs run `dbt run` or `dbt build` to update and view models and their metadata in Catalog."

Which specific environment types in dbt Cloud will update the centralized Catalog (Explorer) upon a successful job run?

</front>

<back>

Only **Production** and **Staging** environments update the Catalog. Jobs run in Development or Continuous Integration (CI) environments do not push updates to the shared metadata view.
