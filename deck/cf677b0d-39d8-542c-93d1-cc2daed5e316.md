In a CI pipeline, you want to build only the models changed in the current PR, plus any downstream models that might be affected by those changes. What command achieves this?

Use state selection with the `+` graph operator appended to the modified selector.

```bash
dbt build --select state:modified+ --state path/to/prod/artifacts
```

The `+` ensures that all downstream dependencies of the modified models are also tested to prevent regressions.
