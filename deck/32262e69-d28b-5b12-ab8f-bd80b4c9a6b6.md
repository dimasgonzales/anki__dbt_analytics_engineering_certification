<front>

You need to ensure a source table causes a pipeline failure if data is older than 24 hours, but simply warns if it is older than 6 hours. How would you configure this in the source YAML?

<back>

Apply a `freshness` block to the specific table (or source) with both thresholds defined:

```yaml
tables:
  - name: orders
    freshness:
      warn_after: {count: 6, period: hour}
      error_after: {count: 24, period: hour}
```

</back>
