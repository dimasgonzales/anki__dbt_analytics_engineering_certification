  explanation: "The reference text mentions `env_var()` in the context of environment variables and hints at securing sensitive values, but does not explicitly confirm that `var()` accesses variables from `dbt_project.yml` or explicitly state the best practice for using `env_var()` for sensitive information in `profiles.yml` as described in the answer."

<front>

What is the functional difference between `var()` and `env_var()`?

</front>

<back>

`var()` accesses variables defined in the `dbt_project.yml` file or passed via the CLI using the `--vars` flag.

`env_var()` retrieves values from the system's environment variables. It is best practice to use `env_var()` for sensitive information like passwords in `profiles.yml`.
