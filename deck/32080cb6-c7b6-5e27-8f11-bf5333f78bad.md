  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text only discusses the `env_var()` function and its use with environment variables, including for credentials in profiles, but does not mention the `var()` function or its functionality. Therefore, the answer's claim about `var()` accessing variables from dbt_project.yml or CLI flags cannot be verified, leading to insufficient evidence for the full functional difference."

<front>

What is the functional difference between `var()` and `env_var()`?

</front>

<back>

`var()` accesses variables defined in the `dbt_project.yml` file or passed via the CLI using the `--vars` flag.

`env_var()` retrieves values from the system's environment variables. It is best practice to use `env_var()` for sensitive information like passwords in `profiles.yml`.
