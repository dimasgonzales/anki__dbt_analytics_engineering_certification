<front>

You are migrating a SQL query to dbt that selects from a table created by another dbt model (`stg_users`). How should you write the `FROM` clause?

</front>

<back>

You should use the `ref()` function. This ensures dbt executes the upstream model first and resolves the correct environment-specific schema.

Correct Syntax:
```sql
FROM {{ ref('stg_users') }}
```

</back>
