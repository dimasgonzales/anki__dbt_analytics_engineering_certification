  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that MetricFlow requires all semantic models to have a primary entity, which can be virtual when no physical primary key exists, directly supporting the answer's claims about the mandatory nature and purpose of 'primary_entity'."
  citation:
    quote: "MetricFlow requires that all semantic models have a primary entity. This is to guarantee unique dimension names. If your data source doesn't have a primary entity, you need to assign the entity a name using the `primary_entity` key."

<front>

Is the 'primary_entity' field required in a semantic model configuration if the underlying data source does not have a primary key?

Yes, `primary_entity` is mandatory for every semantic model because it defines the namespace for the dimensions. If no physical primary key exists (e.g., in an aggregated table), you still define a name which acts as a 'virtual' entity.
