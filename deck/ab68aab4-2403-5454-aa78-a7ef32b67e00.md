<front>

Is the 'primary_entity' field required in a semantic model configuration if the underlying data source does not have a primary key?

Yes, `primary_entity` is mandatory for every semantic model because it defines the namespace for the dimensions. If no physical primary key exists (e.g., in an aggregated table), you still define a name which acts as a 'virtual' entity.
