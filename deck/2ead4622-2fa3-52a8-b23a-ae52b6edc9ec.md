  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text confirms that selected_resources is empty during the parsing phase and demonstrates the use of {% if execute %} to conditionally run logic during execution, aligning with the answer's explanation."
  citation:
    quote: "dbt actively builds the graph during the [parsing phase](/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/execute) of running dbt projects, so the selected_resources context variable will be empty during parsing."

<front>

Why is it necessary to wrap logic accessing `selected_resources` inside an `{% if execute %}` block?

<back>

dbt constructs the DAG during the parsing phase, at which point the `selected_resources` variable is empty. The `execute` flag ensures that the logic accessing this variable only runs during the execution phase when the variable is populated, preventing errors or incorrect evaluation during parsing.
