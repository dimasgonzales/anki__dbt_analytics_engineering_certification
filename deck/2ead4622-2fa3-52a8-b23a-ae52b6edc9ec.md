<front>

Why is it necessary to wrap logic accessing `selected_resources` inside an `{% if execute %}` block?

<back>

dbt constructs the DAG during the parsing phase, at which point the `selected_resources` variable is empty. The `execute` flag ensures that the logic accessing this variable only runs during the execution phase when the variable is populated, preventing errors or incorrect evaluation during parsing.
