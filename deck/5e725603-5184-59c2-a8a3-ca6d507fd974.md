  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that surrogate keys help ensure data completeness, uniqueness, and enable joins across data models. It also discusses compound keys and the need to generate keys from multiple dimensions, with code examples showing hashing, which aligns with the answer's description of surrogate keys being generated from multiple columns for joins."

    quote: "Having a column that uniquely represents each entity helps ensure your data model is complete, does not contain duplicates, and able to join across different data models in your warehouse."

What is a surrogate key in dbt data modeling and why is it used for joins?

A surrogate key is a unique identifier generated (often via hashing) from multiple columns. It is used to create a single, unique join key, replacing complex multi-column join conditions (e.g., joining on Date + Region + Product).
