<front>

You are writing a complex selector string using intersection logic and exclude flags but want to ensure it doesn't accidentally skip critical models. How can you troubleshoot this?

</front>

<back>

Run `dbt ls` with your selector string before running the actual job.

```bash
dbt ls --select "tag:critical,config.materialized:incremental" --exclude "package:deprecated"
```

This lists the resulting nodes so you can validate the logic.
