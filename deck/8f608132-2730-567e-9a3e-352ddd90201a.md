What are the two primary functions of the `ref()` function in dbt?

</front>

<back>

1. **Dependency Management**: It builds the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) by telling dbt that the current model depends on the referenced model.
2. **Schema/Table Resolution**: It compiles to the correct `database.schema.table` name for the current environment (e.g., `dbt_dev` vs `prod`).

Usage:
```sql
SELECT * FROM {{ ref('model_name') }}
```
