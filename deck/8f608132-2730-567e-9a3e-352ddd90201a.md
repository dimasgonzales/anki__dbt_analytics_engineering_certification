  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly supports both functions of the ref() function mentioned in the answer: it infers dependencies for model build order and ensures environment-specific table resolution."
  citation:
    quote: "Using the `ref` function allows dbt to infer dependencies, ensuring that models are built in the correct order. It also ensures that your current model selects from upstream tables and views in the same environment that you're working in."

<front>

What are the two primary functions of the `ref()` function in dbt?

</front>

<back>

1. **Dependency Management**: It builds the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) by telling dbt that the current model depends on the referenced model.
2. **Schema/Table Resolution**: It compiles to the correct `database.schema.table` name for the current environment (e.g., `dbt_dev` vs `prod`).

Usage:
```sql
SELECT * FROM {{ ref('model_name') }}
```
