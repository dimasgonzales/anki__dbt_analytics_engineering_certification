  explanation: "The reference text explicitly discusses setting 'latest_version' to manage which version is current and adding a 'deprecation_date' to mark old versions for removal, aligning directly with the answer's configuration for releasing v2 and deprecating v1."
  citation:
    quote: "set a deprecation date, and communicating a clear window for consumers to gracefully migrate off old versions. [...] the `latest_version` would be `2`, because it's numerically greatest. In this case, we've explicitly specified that `latest_version: 1`. [...] bump `latest_version: 2`, or remove `latest_version` from the specification."

<front>

You are refactoring `dim_customers` and want to release a new version (v2) while marking v1 for removal on December 31st. How do you configure this lifecycle?

Set `latest_version: 2` and add a `deprecation_date` to the v1 configuration block.

```yaml
models:
  - name: dim_customers
    latest_version: 2
    versions:
      - v: 2
      - v: 1
        deprecation_date: 2025-12-31
```

</back>
