<front>

You attempt to run a model and receive the error: `Reached EOF without finding a close tag for macro`. Is this a Compilation or Database error, and what should you check?

</front>

<back>

This is a **Compilation Error**. The SQL was never sent to the database because dbt failed to parse the Jinja. You should check the source code in your `macros/` or `models/` folders for unclosed Jinja blocks (e.g., missing `{% endmacro %}` or `{% endif %}`).
