  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer is supported by the reference text, which explicitly states that the error 'Reached EOF without finding a close tag for macro' is a Compilation Error caused by missing Jinja closing tags, such as a forgotten '{% endmacro %}' tag, and advises checking the relevant file."
  citation:
    quote: "Compilation Error in macro (macros/cents_to_dollars.sql) Reached EOF without finding a close tag for macro (searched from line 1). This particular example is for a forgotten `{% endmacro %}` tag."

<front>

You attempt to run a model and receive the error: `Reached EOF without finding a close tag for macro`. Is this a Compilation or Database error, and what should you check?

<back>

This is a **Compilation Error**. The SQL was never sent to the database because dbt failed to parse the Jinja. You should check the source code in your `macros/` or `models/` folders for unclosed Jinja blocks (e.g., missing `{% endmacro %}` or `{% endif %}`).
