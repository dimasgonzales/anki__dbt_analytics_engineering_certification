<front>

Where must platform-specific performance configurations, such as `partition_by`, `cluster_by`, or `zorder`, be defined in a dbt model?

</front>

<back>

These must be defined inside the `{{ config() }}` block (or in `dbt_project.yml`). They are arguments passed to the materialization macro, not standard SQL syntax written in the model body.

```sql
{{ config(
  materialized='table',
  cluster_by=['customer_id']
) }}
```

</back>
