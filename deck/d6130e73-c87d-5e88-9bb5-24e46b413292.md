  explanation: "The reference text indicates that invalidate_hard_deletes is a legacy config replaced by hard_deletes, but it does not provide explicit details on its functionality to verify the answer's description of marking deleted records with a non-null end date."

What does the `invalidate_hard_deletes` snapshot config option do?

</front>

<back>

When set to true, records that were deleted in the source table will be marked as no longer valid (i.e. will receive a non-null "end date") in the snapshot table. By default, this does not happen--if a record is deleted in the source table, its most recent instance in the snapshot table is not affected at all.
