<front>

Your `dbt_project.yml` configures all models in the `marts` directory to run as views. However, you need one specific model in that folder to be built as a table for performance reasons. How do you accomplish this?

<back>

Add a config block to the top of that specific model file setting `materialized='table'`. In dbt, model-level configurations (in-file) always override project-level configurations (in `dbt_project.yml`).
