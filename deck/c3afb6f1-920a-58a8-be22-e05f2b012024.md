<front>

You are writing a Python model using a Snowflake backend but want to use native Pandas methods (in-memory) for a specific transformation. After calling `dbt.ref()`, what step is often required?

</front>

<back>

You must explicitly convert the lazy-evaluated relation object returned by `dbt.ref()` into a local memory DataFrame (often using methods like `.to_pandas()` or `.df()`) before you can apply standard in-memory Pandas operations.

Example:
```python
# Convert to local Pandas DF
pandas_df = dbt.ref("my_model").to_pandas()
```
