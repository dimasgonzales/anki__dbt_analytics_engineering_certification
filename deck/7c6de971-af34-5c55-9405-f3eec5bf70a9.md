<front>

You have a 'Raw Ingestion' job and a 'Daily Marts' job. You want 'Daily Marts' to run immediately after 'Raw Ingestion' finishes, regardless of how long ingestion takes. Which trigger method should you use?

You should use the **Run on completion** (job chaining) trigger.

Configure the 'Daily Marts' job to trigger specifically when the 'Raw Ingestion' job succeeds. This avoids guessing time windows and prevents race conditions.
