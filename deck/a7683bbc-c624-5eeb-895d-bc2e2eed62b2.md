<front>

You are defining a foreign key constraint in a model contract and need to reference a parent model `dim_products`. How do you write the YAML to ensure the reference works across environments?

</front>

<back>

Use the `ref()` function within the `to` property of the constraint configuration to maintain lineage.
```yaml
- type: foreign_key
  columns: [product_id]
  to: ref('dim_products')
  to_columns: [product_id]
```

</back>
