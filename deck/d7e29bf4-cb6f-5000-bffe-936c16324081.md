<front>

In a generic test definition `{% test my_test(model, column_name) %}`, how do the `model` and `column_name` arguments get populated when used in a `schema.yml` file?

</front>

<back>

dbt automatically injects these values based on the context in the `schema.yml` file.

- `{{ model }}` resolves to the table or view name being tested.
- `{{ column_name }}` resolves to the specific column under which the test is nested.

</back>
