<front>

You have a CI process that runs `dbt compile` to check SQL syntax. You want to run `dbt test` simultaneously to check data quality on existing tables. Will these commands block each other?

**No.**

Both `dbt compile` and `dbt test` are **Read** commands. dbt allows multiple Read commands to execute concurrently on the same project without conflict.
