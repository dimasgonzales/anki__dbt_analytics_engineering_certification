<front>

You have configured an incremental model with a composite `unique_key`, but you are seeing duplicate records in the target table instead of updates. What data quality issue is the most likely cause?

<back>

One or more columns in your composite key contain `NULL` values. In SQL, `NULL != NULL`, so the merge condition fails to match the incoming row with the existing row, causing dbt to treat the record as 'new' and insert a duplicate.
