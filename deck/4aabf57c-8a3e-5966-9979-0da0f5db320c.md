<front>

You encounter the following error when running dbt:
```
Runtime Error
  Failed to read package: Runtime Error
    Invalid config version: 1, expected 2
  Error encountered in dbt_utils/dbt_project.yml
```
How should you troubleshoot and resolve this?

You should update the version of `dbt_utils` in your `packages.yml` file. The error shows the package is using an old config version (1) while your dbt Core expects version 2. Checking dbt Hub for a newer release and running `dbt deps` will resolve this.
