<front>

You have a versioned model with versions 1, 2, and 3. You want to apply a unit test to versions 2 and 3 (and any future versions), but version 1 is a legacy version that is incompatible with this test. What is the most efficient configuration?

</front>

<back>

Use the `exclude` configuration to omit version 1.

```yaml
versions:
  exclude:
    - 1
```
This allows the test to automatically run on v2, v3, and any newly created versions while skipping the legacy version.
