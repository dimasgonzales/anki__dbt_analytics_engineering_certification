<front>

A business stakeholder viewing the dbt Docs notices a warning flag on a 'Revenue Dashboard' exposure regarding data freshness. What underlying dbt feature generates this status?

</front>

<back>

This status is generated by **Source Freshness** checks (`dbt source freshness`). The exposure inherits this status because it explicitly depends on a source (via `parentsSources`) that has failed its defined freshness criteria (e.g., data hasn't loaded in the last 24 hours).
