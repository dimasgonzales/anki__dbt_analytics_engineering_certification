  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The Reference Text confirms that source freshness checks can generate warnings and errors, as indicated by the quote. However, it does not mention exposures, dashboards, or the inheritance mechanism via 'parentsSources' described in the answer, so there is insufficient information to fully verify the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "Use a `freshness` block to define expectations about how frequently a table is updated with new data, and to raise warnings and errors when those expectation are not met."

<front>

A business stakeholder viewing the dbt Docs notices a warning flag on a 'Revenue Dashboard' exposure regarding data freshness. What underlying dbt feature generates this status?

</front>

<back>

This status is generated by **Source Freshness** checks (`dbt source freshness`). The exposure inherits this status because it explicitly depends on a source (via `parentsSources`) that has failed its defined freshness criteria (e.g., data hasn't loaded in the last 24 hours).
