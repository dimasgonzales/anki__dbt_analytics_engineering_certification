  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text provides evidence that source freshness checks generate statuses via `dbt source freshness`, as seen in the section on checking source freshness. However, the text does not mention exposures, the term 'parentsSources', or how exposures inherit freshness status from sources. Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the complete answer, particularly the mechanism of exposure inheritance."

<front>

A business stakeholder viewing the dbt Docs notices a warning flag on a 'Revenue Dashboard' exposure regarding data freshness. What underlying dbt feature generates this status?

</front>

<back>

This status is generated by **Source Freshness** checks (`dbt source freshness`). The exposure inherits this status because it explicitly depends on a source (via `parentsSources`) that has failed its defined freshness criteria (e.g., data hasn't loaded in the last 24 hours).
