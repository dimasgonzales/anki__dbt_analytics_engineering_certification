  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The Reference Text confirms that the `dbt seed` command loads CSV files from the seeds directory, but it does not mention the `dbt run` command or its functionality regarding models and seeds. There is no information to support or contradict the claim that `dbt run` only builds models and does not load seeds."

<front>

Your dbt project contains models, seeds, and tests. You execute `dbt run` successfully, but notice that a CSV seed file update was not reflected in the data warehouse. Why?

<back>

The `dbt run` command only builds models (SQL files). It does not load seeds. 

To update the seed in the warehouse, you must run:
```bash
dbt seed
```
Or run `dbt build` to execute both seeds and models.
