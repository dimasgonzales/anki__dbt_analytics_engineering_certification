<front>

Your dbt project contains models, seeds, and tests. You execute `dbt run` successfully, but notice that a CSV seed file update was not reflected in the data warehouse. Why?

<back>

The `dbt run` command only builds models (SQL files). It does not load seeds. 

To update the seed in the warehouse, you must run:
```bash
dbt seed
```
Or run `dbt build` to execute both seeds and models.
