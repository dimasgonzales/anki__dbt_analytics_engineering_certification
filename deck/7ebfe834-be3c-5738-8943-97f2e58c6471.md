<front>

You are debugging a data discrepancy in a downstream `fct_revenue` model and need to find all raw sources that contribute data to it. How would you accomplish this using the Discovery API?

</front>

<back>

You would query the `fct_revenue` model node and request the `ancestors` field, filtering specifically for the `Source` type. This traverses the DAG upstream to return all source nodes feeding into the model.

```graphql
ancestors(types: [Source]) {
  name
  sourceName
}
```

</back>
