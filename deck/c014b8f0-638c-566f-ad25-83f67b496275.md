<front>

You want the `dbt_project_evaluator` package to 'warn' on violations during local development but return an 'error' (failing the build) in the CI pipeline. How do you achieve this?

Set the severity configuration in `dbt_project.yml` using an environment variable.

Example:
```yaml
data_tests:
  dbt_project_evaluator:
    +severity: "{{ env_var('DBT_PROJECT_EVALUATOR_SEVERITY', 'warn') }}"
```
Then, set the env var to 'error' in your CI environment.
