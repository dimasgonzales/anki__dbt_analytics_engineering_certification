  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text from selectors/rank_3.md explicitly describes the plus operator's placement in dbt, confirming that '+model' selects upstream ancestors, 'model+' selects downstream descendants, and '+model+' selects both, matching the answer exactly."
  citation:
    quote: "Placed after a model/resource — Includes the resource itself and all its descendants (downstream dependencies). Placed before a model/resource — Includes the resource itself and all its ancestors (upstream dependencies). Placed on both sides of a model/resource — Includes the resource itself, all its ancestors, and all its descendants."

<front>

In dbt, how does the placement of the plus (`+`) operator affect which dependencies are selected?

The placement determines the direction of the lineage traversal:

*   `+model`: Selects the model and all **upstream** ancestors (parents).
*   `model+`: Selects the model and all **downstream** descendants (children).
*   `+model+`: Selects the model and **both** upstream and downstream lineage.
