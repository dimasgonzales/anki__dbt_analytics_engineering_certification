<front>

In dbt, how does the placement of the plus (`+`) operator affect which dependencies are selected?

</front>

<back>

The placement determines the direction of the lineage traversal:

*   `+model`: Selects the model and all **upstream** ancestors (parents).
*   `model+`: Selects the model and all **downstream** descendants (children).
*   `+model+`: Selects the model and **both** upstream and downstream lineage.

</back>
