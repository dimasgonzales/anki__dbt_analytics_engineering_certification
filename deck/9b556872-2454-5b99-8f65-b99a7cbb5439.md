<front>

A model named `monthly_revenue` fails because it attempts to run before `daily_sales`, the table it reads from, has been created. What is the problem and how do you fix it?

</front>

<back>

The model is likely using a **hard-coded table name** (e.g., `FROM analytics.daily_sales`) instead of the `ref()` function.

Without `ref()`, dbt cannot detect the dependency (the `parentIds` will be missing) and cannot guarantee the correct execution order. Fix this by changing the SQL to:

```sql
FROM {{ ref('daily_sales') }}
```
