What are generic tests in dbt?

</front>

<back>

**Generic tests**, unlike singular tests, are meant to be reused across many disparate models. There are four built-in generic tests (though the behavior of these can be overwritten per-project if needed):
  

- unique
- not\_null
- accepted\_values
- relationships

You can also define custom generic tests using a `{% test test_name(model, column_name, optional_arg1...) %}` block that works similar to a macro. The `model` and `column_name` arguments are standardized, and all generic tests must use at least the "model" argument, and optionally also the "column\_name" argument. Generic tests can also take custom, additional arguments on top of the 2 default ones. Custom generic tests can be stored in the `tests/generic/` or `macros/` directories.

  
  
All generic tests (built-in and custom) are applied the same way--by listing the test under the `tests` attribute for a given model's/column's yaml configuration.
