  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that the SSH protocol must be used for cloning repositories in dbt Cloud, and HTTPS is not supported, which matches the answer provided."
  citation:
    quote: "You must use the `git@...` or `ssh:..`. version of your git URL, not the `https://...` version. dbt uses the SSH protocol to clone repositories, so dbt will be unable to clone repos supplied with the HTTP protocol."

<front>

When importing a project into dbt Cloud using the 'Git clone' method, which URL protocol must be used?

<back>

You must use the **SSH protocol**. dbt Cloud requires the repository URL to be in the SSH format (e.g., `git@github.com:org/repo.git`). HTTPS URLs are not supported for this import method and will result in a connection failure.
