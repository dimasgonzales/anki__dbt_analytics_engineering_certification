<front>

When importing a project into dbt Cloud using the 'Git clone' method, which URL protocol must be used?

</front>

<back>

You must use the **SSH protocol**. dbt Cloud requires the repository URL to be in the SSH format (e.g., `git@github.com:org/repo.git`). HTTPS URLs are not supported for this import method and will result in a connection failure.
