  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that `unique_id` is used to reference data in `manifest.json` and shows `unique_id` as a key in examples from both `run_results.json` and `manifest.json`, confirming it as the shared key for joining data."
  citation:
    quote: "Continue to look up additional information about the `logical` state of nodes using the full node object in manifest.json via the `unique_id`."

<front>

What shared key must be used to join data between `run_results.json` and `manifest.json`?

<back>

The `unique_id`.

`run_results.json` contains execution data (time, status) keyed by `unique_id`, while `manifest.json` contains configuration data (tags, resource type, filepath) keyed by the same `unique_id`.
