<front>

You have defined an exposure and a job runs successfully, but the Data Health Tile shows no data for 'Source Freshness'. What is the likely cause?

The dbt Cloud job executing the run likely has **Source Freshness** disabled. Without running `dbt source freshness` during the job, dbt cannot populate the staleness component of the health tile.
