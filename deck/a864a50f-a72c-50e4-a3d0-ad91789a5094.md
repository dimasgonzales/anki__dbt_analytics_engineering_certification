  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text confirms that 'dbt debug' is a command for testing database connections and system setup, and explicitly distinguishes it from the '--debug' option, which increases logging verbosity, aligning with the answer's description."

What is the difference between the command `dbt debug` and the global flag `--debug`?

`dbt debug` is a specific **command** that runs a health check on your environment and setup. The `--debug` **flag** (e.g., `dbt run --debug`) increases logging verbosity for *any* command, allowing you to see detailed debug information like raw SQL queries.
