What is the difference between the command `dbt debug` and the global flag `--debug`?

`dbt debug` is a specific **command** that runs a health check on your environment and setup. The `--debug` **flag** (e.g., `dbt run --debug`) increases logging verbosity for *any* command, allowing you to see detailed debug information like raw SQL queries.
