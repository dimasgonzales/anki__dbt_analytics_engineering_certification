What is the purpose of the `dbt ls` command, and how does the `--output name` flag modify its behavior?

`dbt ls` lists resources (models, sources, seeds, etc.) in your project based on selection criteria. Adding `--output name` modifies the output to return only the names of the resources (instead of the default full path/details), which is useful for piping into other scripts.
