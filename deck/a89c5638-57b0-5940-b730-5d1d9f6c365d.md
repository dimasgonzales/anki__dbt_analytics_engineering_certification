  verdict: CONTRADICTED
  explanation: "The text confirms that dbt ls lists resources, but it contradicts the answer's claim that the default output is 'full path/details'. The example shows default output as resource names without full paths when no --output flag is used. Additionally, the specific effect of --output name is not explicitly detailed beyond being listed as an option."

<front>

What is the purpose of the `dbt ls` command, and how does the `--output name` flag modify its behavior?

`dbt ls` lists resources (models, sources, seeds, etc.) in your project based on selection criteria. Adding `--output name` modifies the output to return only the names of the resources (instead of the default full path/details), which is useful for piping into other scripts.
