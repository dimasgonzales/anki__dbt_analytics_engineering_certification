  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The Reference Text confirms that 'dbt ls' lists resources, as seen in the cli-commands source, and mentions the default output is FQN in the grants source, but it does not contain any information about the '--output name' flag or how it modifies the output. Therefore, the answer's claim regarding the flag cannot be verified with the provided evidence."

<front>

What is the purpose of the `dbt ls` command, and how does the `--output name` flag modify its behavior?

<back>

`dbt ls` lists resources (models, sources, seeds, etc.) in your project based on selection criteria. Adding `--output name` modifies the output to return only the names of the resources (instead of the default full path/details), which is useful for piping into other scripts.
