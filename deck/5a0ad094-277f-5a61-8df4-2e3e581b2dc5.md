  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly supports the answer: it states that `grants` sets permissions for resources, dbt enforces them via grant/revoke statements during build (run, seed, snapshot), and it applies to models, seeds, and snapshots."
  citation:
    quote: "When you `run` a model, `seed` data, or `snapshot` a dataset, dbt will run `grant` and/or `revoke` statements to ensure that the permissions on the database object match the `grants` you have configured on the resource."

<front>

What is the purpose of the `grants` configuration in dbt and which resources does it apply to?

<back>

`grants` allows you to define database permissions (like `select`) for specific recipients (roles/users). dbt enforces this state at build time by running the necessary grant/revoke statements. It applies to **models, seeds, and snapshots**.
