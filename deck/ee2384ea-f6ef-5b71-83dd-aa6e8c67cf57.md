  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that seeds are best suited for business-specific logic like country codes or employee IDs, and should not be used for raw data, which aligns with the answer's claims about static reference data and avoidance of raw source loading."
  citation:
    quote: "Seeds should **not** be used to load raw data (for example, large CSV exports from a production database). Since seeds are version controlled, they are best suited to files that contain business-specific logic, for example a list of country codes or user IDs of employees."

What is the intended purpose of `seeds` in dbt, and what should they NOT be used for?

<back>

Seeds are used for loading **static reference data** (e.g., country codes, employee mappings) via CSV files in the repository. They should **NOT** be used to load raw source data; that is the job of an EL (Extract/Load) tool.
