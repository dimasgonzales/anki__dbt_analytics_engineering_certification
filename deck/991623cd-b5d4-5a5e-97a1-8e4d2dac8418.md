<front>

You are viewing the Lineage tab in the dbt Cloud IDE and want to visualize `finance_model` along with all of its downstream dependencies. What selector string should you enter?

<back>

You should enter `finance_model+`.

The IDE supports standard node selection syntax where the `+` suffix selects the model and all its children (downstream dependencies).
