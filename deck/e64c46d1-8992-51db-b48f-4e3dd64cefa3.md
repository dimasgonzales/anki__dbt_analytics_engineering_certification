<front>

You need to change the `star_schema` config variable for the installed `snowplow` package to `false`. Given the `dbt_project.yml` below, where does this config belong?

```yaml
name: my_project
config-version: 2
# ... models config ...
```

</front>

<back>

It belongs under a `vars` block at the root level, scoped to the package name.

```yaml
vars:
  snowplow:
    snowplow:star_schema: false
```

</back>
