  verdict: CONTRADICTED
  explanation: "The answer suggests using 'config:tags:daily', but the reference text explicitly shows that the correct selector syntax for running models by tag is 'tag:daily', with no mention of a 'config:tags:' prefix."

<back>

You should use the config selector syntax:

```bash
dbt run --select config:tags:daily
```

This targets resources based on the `tags` configuration specifically.
