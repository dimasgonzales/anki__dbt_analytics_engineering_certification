  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer correctly states that the command `dbt run --select tag:daily` is used to execute models tagged with 'daily'. This is explicitly supported by the reference text, which provides an example of this exact command for running all models tagged 'daily'."

You should use the config selector syntax:

```bash
dbt run --select tag:daily
```

This targets resources based on the `tags` configuration specifically.
