<front>

You updated a package version in `packages.yml` to allow for a newer release, but running `dbt deps` is still installing the old version. How do you fix this?

</front>

<back>

Run `dbt deps --upgrade`. 

By default, `dbt deps` respects the versions pinned in `package-lock.yml`. The `--upgrade` flag forces dbt to ignore the lock file and resolve dependencies to the latest versions allowed by your configuration.
