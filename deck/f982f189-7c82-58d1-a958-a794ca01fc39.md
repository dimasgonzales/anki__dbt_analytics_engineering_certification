  explanation: "The reference text confirms that configurations can be defined in dbt_project.yml, properties.yml files, and via the config() macro in .sql files, matching the answer's three locations. It also states that configurations are applied hierarchically with the most specific taking precedence, supporting the claim that in-file configuration has the highest precedence."

<front>

What are the three locations where dbt model configurations can be defined, and which one takes precedence?

<back>

Configurations can be defined in:
1. `dbt_project.yml` (Project level)
2. `properties.yml` (Schema/directory level)
3. `{{ config() }}` macro (Model file level)

The **in-file configuration** using the `{{ config() }}` macro takes the highest precedence, overriding project and property file settings.
