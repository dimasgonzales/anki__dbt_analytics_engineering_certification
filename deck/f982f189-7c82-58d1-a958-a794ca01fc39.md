<front>

What are the three locations where dbt model configurations can be defined, and which one takes precedence?

</front>

<back>

Configurations can be defined in:
1. `dbt_project.yml` (Project level)
2. `properties.yml` (Schema/directory level)
3. `{{ config() }}` macro (Model file level)

The **in-file configuration** using the `{{ config() }}` macro takes the highest precedence, overriding project and property file settings.
