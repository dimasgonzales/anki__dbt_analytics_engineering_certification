  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly recommends configuring tests on materialized views with store_failures_as to store failures as a view, aligning with the answer's recommendation to set it to 'view' for inspection of failing records."
  citation:
    quote: "update any tests applied to a materialized view/dynamic table with the [store_failures_as](/reference/resource-configs/store_failures_as) configuration set to true and materialized as a view."

<front>

What test configuration is recommended for Materialized Views to allow for the inspection of failing records after the test run completes?

`store_failures_as = 'view'`

Configuring this (available in dbt v1.7+) saves the rows that failed the test into a persistent database view, allowing for easier debugging of continuous pipelines where data changes rapidly.
