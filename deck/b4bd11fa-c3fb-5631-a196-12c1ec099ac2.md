<front>

You are setting up a public interface for a dbt Mesh project. Why does the following configuration result in a parsing error?
```yaml
models:
  - name: int_events
    config:
      materialized: ephemeral
      access: public
```

</front>

<back>

This errors because `ephemeral` models cannot be exposed publicly. 

To expose this logic to other projects, you must change the materialization to a persistent strategy, such as `view` or `table`.
