<front>

You have added a `dbt sqlfluff lint` step to your CI pipeline using the dbt Cloud CLI. You notice the pipeline passes (exit code 0) even though the logs show linting violations. Why does this happen?

<back>

The dbt Cloud CLI implementation of `dbt sqlfluff` currently returns an **exit code of 0** regardless of whether violations are found. To fail the pipeline on violations, you would need to parse the output or use the standalone SQLFluff CLI instead.
