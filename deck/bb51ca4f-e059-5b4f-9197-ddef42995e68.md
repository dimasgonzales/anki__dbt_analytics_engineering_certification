By default, how does a dbt snapshot handle a row that is physically deleted from the source table?

By default, dbt **ignores** deletions. The last known state of the record remains "active" (with `dbt_valid_to` as null) indefinitely because dbt only updates records when it detects a matching key with changed data.
