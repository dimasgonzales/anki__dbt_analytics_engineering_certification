  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The Reference Text describes how dbt snapshots handle updates and new records, such as updating 'dbt_valid_to' for changed records and inserting new records with 'dbt_valid_to' as null, but it does not address or mention the handling of row deletions from the source table. Therefore, there is insufficient information in the provided text to verify or contradict the answer's claim about deletions."

<front>

By default, how does a dbt snapshot handle a row that is physically deleted from the source table?

<back>

By default, dbt **ignores** deletions. The last known state of the record remains "active" (with `dbt_valid_to` as null) indefinitely because dbt only updates records when it detects a matching key with changed data.
