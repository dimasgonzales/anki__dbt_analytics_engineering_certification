How does `--warn-error-options` differ from `--warn-error` in dbt CLI commands?

<back>

`--warn-error` is a global switch that turns **all** warnings into errors. In contrast, `--warn-error-options` allows for **granular control** by accepting a JSON configuration to specify exactly which warnings should be treated as errors, which should remain warnings, and which should be silenced.

Note: These two flags are mutually exclusive.
