<front>

You have a dbt Cloud job configured with the 'Run source freshness' checkbox enabled and a command step of `dbt build`. If one of your sources is stale (fails freshness), but all models build successfully, what happens to the job execution?

</front>

<back>

The job will **proceed** to the `dbt build` step and likely finish with a status of **Success** (or Warn).

Because the freshness check was configured via the UI checkbox, dbt treats it as a non-blocking step, allowing the downstream commands to execute despite the freshness failure.
