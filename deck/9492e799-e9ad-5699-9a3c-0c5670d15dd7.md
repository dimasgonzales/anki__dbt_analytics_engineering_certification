<front>

What is the primary difference between `dbt compile` and `dbt run`?

</front>

<back>

`dbt compile` resolves Jinja references into raw SQL files located in `target/compiled/` but **does not** execute them against the database.

`dbt run` performs the compilation step and then **executes** the resulting SQL to create or update database objects.
