  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that dbt compile generates SQL but does not materialize it, while dbt run does, which supports the answer's claim that compile does not execute SQL against the database, whereas run does."
  citation:
    quote: "`dbt compile` is similar to `dbt run` except that it doesn't materialize the model's compiled SQL into an existing table."

<front>

What is the primary difference between `dbt compile` and `dbt run`?

</front>

<back>

`dbt compile` resolves Jinja references into raw SQL files located in `target/compiled/` but **does not** execute them against the database.

`dbt run` performs the compilation step and then **executes** the resulting SQL to create or update database objects.
