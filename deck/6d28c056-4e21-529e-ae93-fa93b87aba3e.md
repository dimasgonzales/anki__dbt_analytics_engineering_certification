You suspect a 'module not found' error is caused by a missing database adapter in your local environment. How would you confirm which adapters are currently installed?

Run `dbt --version` in your terminal. Check the `Plugins` section of the output to see if the required adapter (e.g., `snowflake`, `bigquery`, `postgres`) is listed. If it is missing from this list, it must be installed via pip.
