<front>

Your team notices that the dbt project startup time has increased significantly. How would you scientifically identify the bottleneck?

**Run `dbt parse` and inspect the `target/perf_info.json` file.**

Review these specific keys to identify the root cause:
* **`load_all_elapsed`**: Shows the total time taken to parse the project.
* **`parsers`**: Breaks down time by file type (e.g., macros vs. YAML), isolating specific bottlenecks.
* **`is_partial_parse_enabled`**: Confirms if dbt is successfully caching previous runs or forced to restart from scratch.
