<front>

You are reviewing a model that includes `FROM raw.stripe.payments` in the SQL. Why is this considered an anti-pattern in dbt?

</front>

<back>

Hardcoding the table name breaks the DAG lineage. dbt will not recognize that this model depends on the `payments` source, preventing dbt from executing them in the correct order or testing the source before the model runs.

**Fix:**
```sql
FROM {{ source('stripe', 'payments') }}
```

</back>
