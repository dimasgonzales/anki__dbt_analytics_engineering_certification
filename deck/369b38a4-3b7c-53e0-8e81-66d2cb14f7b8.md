<front>

What is the default behavior of dbt when a custom `schema` configuration is provided for a model?

</front>

<back>

By default, dbt concatenates the target schema and the custom schema using an underscore. It does **not** replace the target schema entirely.

Pattern:
`<target_schema>_<custom_schema>`
