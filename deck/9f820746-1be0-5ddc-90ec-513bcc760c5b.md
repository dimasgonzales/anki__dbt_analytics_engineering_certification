  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that dbt does not test the uniqueness of the `unique_key`, confirming that defining it does not automatically ensure data uniqueness or trigger validation tests."

<front>

Does defining a `unique_key` in your model configuration automatically ensure that the data in that column is unique?

No. The `unique_key` config is used solely for generating SQL (MERGE/UPDATE statements). It does not trigger a validation test. If the data contains duplicates, the SQL operation will still run but may produce incorrect results.
