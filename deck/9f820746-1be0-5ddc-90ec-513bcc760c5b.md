<front>

Does defining a `unique_key` in your model configuration automatically ensure that the data in that column is unique?

No. The `unique_key` config is used solely for generating SQL (MERGE/UPDATE statements). It does not trigger a validation test. If the data contains duplicates, the SQL operation will still run but may produce incorrect results.
