<front>

You are running a `dbt run` in production which takes 30 minutes. A user queries a table 15 minutes into the run while dbt is currently rebuilding that specific model. What data will the user see?

</front>

---

<back>

The user will see the **old data** from the previous run. Because dbt builds the new table separately and swaps it atomically at the very end, the old table remains live and queryable until the moment the new table is ready.
