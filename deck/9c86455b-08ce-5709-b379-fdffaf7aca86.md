  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer accurately reflects the order of precedence for environment variables in dbt Cloud as explicitly stated in the reference text, listing the same four levels in the correct sequence from highest to lowest precedence."
  citation:
    quote: "allowing users to define values at four levels (highest to lowest order of precedence): * The job level (job override) or in the Studio IDE for an individual developer (personal override). *Highest precedence* * The environment level, which can be overridden by the job level or personal override. * A project-wide default value, which can be overridden by the environment level, job level, or personal override. * The optional default argument supplied to the `env_var` Jinja function in the code. *Lowest precedence*"
