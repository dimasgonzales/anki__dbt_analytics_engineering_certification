<front>

You need to ensure that your CI pipeline tests the actual incremental logic (e.g., `is_incremental()`) rather than just building tables from scratch. Which command sequence achieves this?

Use `dbt clone` to create zero-copy clones of production tables in the CI schema, followed by the build command. 

```bash
# 1. Clone existing state to CI schema
dbt clone --select state:modified+ ...

# 2. Run incremental logic against cloned tables
dbt build --select state:modified+
```

</back>
