How can `dbt clone` be used to optimize CI pipelines for large incremental models?

It allows you to simulate an incremental run without a full refresh. 

You **clone** the production state of the model to the CI schema first, then run the new code **incrementally** against that clone, verifying the incremental logic works without processing the entire historical dataset.
