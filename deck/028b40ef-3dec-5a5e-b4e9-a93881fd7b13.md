  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that `field` and `to` are the additional arguments required to specify the relationship in the `relationships` test, which aligns with the answer claiming these two arguments are mandatory. The context confirms they are necessary to define the parent model and the matching column."

What two arguments are mandatory when configuring the built-in `relationships` test in dbt?

You must provide:
1. `to`: The reference to the parent model using `ref()` or `source()`.
2. `field`: The name of the column in the parent model to match against.

```yaml
- relationships:
    to: ref('dim_customers')
    field: customer_id
```
