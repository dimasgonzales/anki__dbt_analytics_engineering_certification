What two arguments are mandatory when configuring the built-in `relationships` test in dbt?

You must provide:
1. `to`: The reference to the parent model using `ref()` or `source()`.
2. `field`: The name of the column in the parent model to match against.

```yaml
- relationships:
    to: ref('dim_customers')
    field: customer_id
```
