<front>

You are setting up a production pipeline and need to ensure that if a model fails, its associated data tests do not run, and downstream models are skipped. Which single command handles this?

```bash
dbt build
```

`dbt build` runs models and tests in a single DAG-aware process. If a model fails, dbt immediately identifies the failure and skips dependent downstream resources (both tests and models).
