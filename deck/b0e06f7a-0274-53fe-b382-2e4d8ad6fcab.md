<front>

You have defined a source table in `sources.yml`, but your Lineage Graph does not show a connection between the source and your staging model. What is the likely cause?

<back>

You likely hard-coded the table reference (e.g., `raw.orders`) in the SQL instead of using the `{{ source() }}` function.

dbt parses the Jinja syntax to build the DAG; if you use raw SQL table names, dbt cannot detect the dependency.
