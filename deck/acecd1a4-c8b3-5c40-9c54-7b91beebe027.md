<front>

If you delete a `.sql` model file from your dbt project and execute `dbt run`, what happens to the corresponding table or view in the data warehouse?

**Nothing happens.** The object remains in the warehouse.

dbt creates and replaces objects but does not perform garbage collection. You must manually execute a `DROP TABLE` or `DROP VIEW` command in the database to remove 'stale' artifacts.
