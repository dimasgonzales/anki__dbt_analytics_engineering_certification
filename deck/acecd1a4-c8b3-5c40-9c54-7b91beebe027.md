  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that dbt does not automatically drop deleted models from the data warehouse, which directly supports the answer that the corresponding table or view remains unchanged after executing 'dbt run'."

<front>

If you delete a `.sql` model file from your dbt project and execute `dbt run`, what happens to the corresponding table or view in the data warehouse?

**Nothing happens.** The object remains in the warehouse.

dbt creates and replaces objects but does not perform garbage collection. You must manually execute a `DROP TABLE` or `DROP VIEW` command in the database to remove 'stale' artifacts.
