<front>

You have `store_failures: false` configured for a specific test in your YAML file. If you execute `dbt test --store-failures`, will the failing records be saved to the database?

<back>

No. Because the configuration is explicitly set to `false` in the file, it overrides the CLI flag. To store failures for this specific test, you must change the config in the YAML file or remove it to allow the CLI flag to take effect.
