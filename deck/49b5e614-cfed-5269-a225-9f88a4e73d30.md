<front>

During a CI deployment, you want to run all models in your project EXCEPT for those in the `marketing` package and any model materialized as `incremental`. How do you construct this command?

</front>

<back>

You should use the `--exclude` flag with a space (Union/OR) to cover both exclusion criteria.

Command:
```bash
dbt run --exclude "package:marketing config.materialized:incremental"
```
This runs everything unless it is in the marketing package OR is an incremental model.
