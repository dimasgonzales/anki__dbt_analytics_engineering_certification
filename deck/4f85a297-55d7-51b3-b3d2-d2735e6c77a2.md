  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly states that the command 'source freshness' generates metadata such as 'max_loaded_at', supporting the first part of the answer. However, it does not contain any information regarding whether this command is included in 'dbt run' or not, making it impossible to verify the second part of the answer."

<front>

Which dbt command generates the metadata required to populate the `maxLoadedAt` field for sources, and is this included in `dbt run`?

</front>

<back>

The command is `dbt source freshness`. This metadata generation is **not** included in `dbt run`; it must be executed separately to update the `maxLoadedAt` and `freshnessStatus` fields.
