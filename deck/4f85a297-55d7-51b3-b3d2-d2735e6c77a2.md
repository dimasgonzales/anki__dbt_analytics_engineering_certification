<front>

Which dbt command generates the metadata required to populate the `maxLoadedAt` field for sources, and is this included in `dbt run`?

</front>

<back>

The command is `dbt source freshness`. This metadata generation is **not** included in `dbt run`; it must be executed separately to update the `maxLoadedAt` and `freshnessStatus` fields.
