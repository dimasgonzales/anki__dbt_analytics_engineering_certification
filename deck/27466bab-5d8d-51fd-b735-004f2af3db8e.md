<front>

How do you apply 'AND' logic (Intersection) within a single dbt selector argument to ensure resources meet multiple criteria?

<back>

Separate the selector methods with a comma (`,`). dbt will only select resources that satisfy *all* the comma-separated conditions.

```bash
# Selects resources that match BOTH criteria
dbt run --select "path.to.model,tag:hourly"
```

</back>
