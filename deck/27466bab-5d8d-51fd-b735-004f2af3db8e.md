  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that using commas to separate selector methods without whitespace in the '--select' argument applies intersection logic (AND), selecting resources that meet all criteria, which matches the answer."
  citation:
    quote: "If you separate multiple arguments for `--select` and `--exclude` with commas and no whitespace in between, dbt will select only resources that satisfy *all* arguments."

<front>

How do you apply 'AND' logic (Intersection) within a single dbt selector argument to ensure resources meet multiple criteria?

<back>

Separate the selector methods with a comma (`,`). dbt will only select resources that satisfy *all* the comma-separated conditions.

```bash
# Selects resources that match BOTH criteria
dbt run --select "path.to.model,tag:hourly"
```
