<front>

A join between your `orders` and `customers` tables is performing poorly on Redshift due to excessive network broadcasting. Both tables are large. How would you refactor the dbt models to fix this?

<back>

Configure both models to be materialized as tables and set their `dist` configuration to the common join key (e.g., `customer_id`).

Example for both models:
```sql
{{ config(
  materialized='table',
  dist='customer_id'
) }}
```
This ensures matching rows are co-located on the same node.
