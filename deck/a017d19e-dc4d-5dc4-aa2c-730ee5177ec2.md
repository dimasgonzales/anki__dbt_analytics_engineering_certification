<front>

You are investigating why a model took an unexpectedly long time to run. You suspect it performed a full refresh instead of an incremental run. Where in the logs can you verify the actual strategy used?

<back>

Check the `data.node_info.materialized` field in the `dbt.log` entry for that model.

This field reflects the actual strategy dbt applied at runtime (e.g., showing `table` instead of `incremental` if the table was missing or `--full-refresh` was used).
