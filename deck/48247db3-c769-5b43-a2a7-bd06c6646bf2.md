<front>

A model materialized as `ephemeral` is causing 'Bytes spilled to remote storage' errors in Snowflake due to high data volume. How should you refactor this model to improve performance?

<back>

Change the materialization to `incremental` (or `table`). This persists the data to the warehouse, reducing memory pressure during complex joins and allowing dbt to process only new records in subsequent runs.

Change config to:
```yaml
{{ config(materialized = 'incremental') }}
```
