<front>

What is the purpose of the `execute` Jinja variable in dbt?

</front>

<back>

The `execute` variable is a boolean that indicates whether dbt is currently in the "execution" phase (running SQL) or the "parsing" phase.

It returns `True` when dbt is executing models and `False` during parsing. This is used to prevent heavy database queries from running during the parsing stage.
