What is the purpose of the `execute` Jinja variable in dbt?

<back>

The `execute` variable is a boolean that indicates whether dbt is currently in the "execution" phase (running SQL) or the "parsing" phase (compiling). 

It returns `True` when dbt is executing models and `False` during compilation. This is used to prevent heavy database queries from running during the parsing stage.
