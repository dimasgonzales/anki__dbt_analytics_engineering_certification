<front>

You have legacy reference data stored in a `legacy_data/` folder and new reference files in `seeds/`. How do you configure dbt to recognize CSVs in both locations?

<back>

Update the `seed-paths` list in `dbt_project.yml` to include both directory names. dbt allows multiple paths for resource discovery.

```yaml
seed-paths: ["seeds", "legacy_data"]
```
