<front>

Your CI pipeline fails because `dbt build` runs a relationship test referencing an upstream model that wasn't built in the current run. How can you fix this using selector configuration?

<back>

Set `indirect_selection: cautious` in your selector definition. This ensures a test is only selected if all of its parent models are included in the current run.

```yaml
definition:
  method: fqn
  value: my_model
  indirect_selection: cautious
```
