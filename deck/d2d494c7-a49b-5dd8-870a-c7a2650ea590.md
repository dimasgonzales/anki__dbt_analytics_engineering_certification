<front>

Your CI/CD pipeline is failing because the runner installed dbt v1.7.0, but your project relies on syntax specific to v1.8. How do you modify `dbt_project.yml` to prevent the pipeline from attempting to run with the older version?

Add or update the `require-dbt-version` config to set a minimum version requirement.

Example:
```yaml
# dbt_project.yml
require-dbt-version: ">=1.8.0"
```
This ensures the command fails immediately with a clear error if an older version is used.
