  explanation: "The reference text discusses command-line selection methods for unit tests and versions, such as using the 'version' method in dbt commands, but it does not provide information on configuration keys for unit tests, specifically whether 'versions' with an 'include' list is used to limit tests to specific model versions."

<front>

Which configuration key should be used to explicitly limit a dbt unit test to run only on a specific list of model versions?

</front>

<back>

Use the `versions` key with a child `include` list in the unit test configuration.

Example:
```yaml
versions:
  include:
    - 2
```

</back>
