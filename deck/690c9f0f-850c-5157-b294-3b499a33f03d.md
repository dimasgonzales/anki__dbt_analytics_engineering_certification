  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text confirms the primary function of the `dbt seed` command by stating it loads CSV files into the data warehouse and demonstrates an INSERT operation, which aligns with the answer. The comparison to `dbt run` is not addressed in the provided evidence, but the core description of `dbt seed` is supported."

What is the primary function of the `dbt seed` command?

<back>

The `dbt seed` command loads static CSV files from the dbt project into the data warehouse as tables. Unlike `dbt run`, which executes SQL transformations, `dbt seed` parses the CSVs and performs an INSERT operation to populate the tables.
