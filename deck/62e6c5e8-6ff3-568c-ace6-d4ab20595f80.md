<front>

You are building a model with `enforced: true` that outputs a column `order_total` as a float. However, your YAML configuration defines `order_total` as an integer. What will happen when you run `dbt build`?

<back>

The build will fail. Because the contract is enforced, dbt checks the data types at build time. Since the actual output (float) does not match the contract (integer), dbt stops execution to prevent the schema violation.
