<front>

You have a model named `int_finance_calculations` configured with `group: finance` and `access: private`. If a model in the `marketing` group attempts to `ref('int_finance_calculations')`, what will happen?

<back>

dbt will raise a `DbtReferenceError`. 

Because the model is `private`, it can only be referenced by other models within the `finance` group. To fix this, you would need to change the access to `protected` or move the downstream model into the `finance` group.
