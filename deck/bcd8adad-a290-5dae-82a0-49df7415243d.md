<front>

You want to ensure that queries against a large partitioned table fail immediately if they do not filter on the partitioning column. How do you configure this in dbt?

</front>

<back>

Set `require_partition_filter = true` in the model configuration. This enforces a BigQuery setting that rejects full table scans or queries missing the partition predicate, saving costs.

```python
{{ config(
    materialized='table',
    require_partition_filter=true
) }}
```

</back>
