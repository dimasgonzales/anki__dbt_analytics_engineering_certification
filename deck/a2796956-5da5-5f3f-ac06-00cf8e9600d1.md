  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly describes the ref function as inferring dependencies for correct model ordering and ensuring selection from the same environment, which directly matches the answer's points on dependency management and environment isolation."
  citation:
    quote: "Using the `ref` function allows dbt to infer dependencies, ensuring that models are built in the correct order. It also ensures that your current model selects from upstream tables and views in the same environment that you're working in."

What are the two primary functions of using the `ref()` function in dbt instead of writing raw SQL table names?

1. **Dependency Management:** It constructs the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) so dbt knows the correct order in which to run models.
2. **Environment Isolation:** It interpolates the correct target database and schema (e.g., `dbt_dev` vs `analytics_prod`) based on your profile, ensuring code is portable across environments.
