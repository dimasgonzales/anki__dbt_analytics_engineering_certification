1. **Dependency Management:** It constructs the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) so dbt knows the correct order in which to run models.
2. **Environment Isolation:** It interpolates the correct target database and schema (e.g., `dbt_dev` vs `analytics_prod`) based on your profile, ensuring code is portable across environments.
