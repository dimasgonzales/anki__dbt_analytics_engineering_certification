  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly confirms that dbt Cloud does not require a local 'profiles.yml' file, as connection details are configured through managed environments in the dbt UI, contrasting with dbt Core's file-based approach."

How does dbt Cloud handle the `profiles.yml` connection configuration compared to dbt Core (CLI)?

<back>

dbt Cloud replaces the local `profiles.yml` file with **managed Environments** (e.g., Development, Deployment).

Connection details are configured in the dbt Cloud UI credentials settings rather than a file in the user's home directory, ensuring secure and consistent access control.
