<front>

A model is configured as `materialized: table` in `dbt_project.yml`, but the model file contains the following code:
```sql
{{ config(materialized='view') }}
select ...
```
How will dbt materialize this model?

</front>

<back>

It will be materialized as a **view**. 

Configurations defined directly inside the model file via the `{{ config() }}` macro always override general configurations set in the `dbt_project.yml` file.
