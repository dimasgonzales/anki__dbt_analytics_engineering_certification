  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The Reference Text explicitly states that 'catalog.json' contains database metadata, such as columns and statistics, and implies that 'manifest.json' contains project-defined information like lineage, which aligns with the answer's distinction between dbt-side and database-side information."
  citation:
    quote: "information gleaned from database metadata (the full set of columns in each table, and statistics about those tables)."

<front>

What is the primary difference between the data stored in `target/manifest.json` vs. `target/catalog.json` after running `dbt docs generate`?

<back>

`manifest.json` contains project resources, configuration, logic, and lineage (dbt-side information). `catalog.json` contains database metadata produced by querying the warehouse, such as column types, table statistics, and row counts (database-side information).
