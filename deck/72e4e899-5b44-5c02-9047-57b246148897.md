  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that `dbt build` operates in DAG order for selected or all resources and that test failures cause downstream resources to be skipped, which supports the answer's claims about execution order and automatic skipping on failures."
  citation:
    quote: "In DAG order, for selected resources or an entire project. Skipping on failures: Tests on upstream resources will block downstream resources from running, and a test failure will cause those downstream resources to skip entirely."

<front>

What is the specific behavior of the `dbt build` command regarding resource execution?

<back>

`dbt build` executes all resources (models, tests, snapshots, seeds) in DAG dependency order. Unlike chaining individual commands, if a resource fails in `dbt build`, dbt automatically skips all downstream resources that depend on it.
