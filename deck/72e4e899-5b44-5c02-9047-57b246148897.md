<front>

What is the specific behavior of the `dbt build` command regarding resource execution?

`dbt build` executes all resources (models, tests, snapshots, seeds) in DAG dependency order. Unlike chaining individual commands, if a resource fails in `dbt build`, dbt automatically skips all downstream resources that depend on it.
