<front>

You added a `region` column to your `office_locations.csv` seed file. When you run `dbt seed`, you get a database error saying the column does not exist. How do you resolve this?

<back>

Run the seed command with the full-refresh flag:
```bash
dbt seed --full-refresh
```
This drops the existing database table and recreates it with the new schema defined in the CSV.
