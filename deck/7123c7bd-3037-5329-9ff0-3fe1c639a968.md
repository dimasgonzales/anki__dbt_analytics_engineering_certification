<front>

You are running a dbt Python model on BigQuery for the first time and receive an error stating `403 Access Denied` regarding Google Cloud Storage. What is the likely cause?

<back>

The service account used by dbt lacks permissions to read/write to the configured GCS staging bucket, or the bucket defined in your profile does not exist.

To resolve, ensure the bucket exists and grant the service account `Storage Object Admin` (or similar) permissions.
