  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly states that `dbt parse` validates Jinja/YAML syntax, generates a manifest, and does not connect to the data warehouse, which aligns with the answer. It also confirms that `dbt compile` requires a database connection for introspective queries, supporting the distinction made in the answer."

<front>

What is the primary function of the `dbt parse` command, and how does it differ from `dbt compile` regarding database connectivity?

<back>

`dbt parse` validates Jinja/YAML syntax and generates the `manifest.json` file representing project resources. Unlike `dbt compile`, `dbt parse` **does not** connect to the data warehouse, meaning it cannot generate fully compiled SQL that relies on database introspection.
