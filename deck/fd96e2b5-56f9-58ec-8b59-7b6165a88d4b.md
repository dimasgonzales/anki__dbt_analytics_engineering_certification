<front>

Is the `selected_resources` variable available when executing a macro via the `dbt run-operation` command?

<back>

No. The `selected_resources` variable is available in contexts like `on-run-start`, `on-run-end`, `pre-hook`, and `post-hook`, but it is **not** populated or accessible when using `dbt run-operation`.
