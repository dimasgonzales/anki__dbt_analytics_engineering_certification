<front>

A scheduled dbt job crashed because of a database connection timeout, causing several models to error out. How can you retry *only* the models that encountered errors (and their downstream children) without re-running successful models?

Use the `result:error+` selector combined with the `--state` flag pointing to the artifacts from the failed run.

```bash
# Retries errored models and their children
dbt run --select "result:error+" --state target
```

</back>
