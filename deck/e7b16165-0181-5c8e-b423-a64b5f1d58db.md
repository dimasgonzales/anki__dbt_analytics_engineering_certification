  explanation: "The Reference Text does not mention the CLI flag --project-dir or the environment variable DBT_PROJECT_DIR. It focuses on directory navigation, general dbt command usage, and installation procedures, but lacks information on these specific options for executing commands from a non-root directory."

<front>

Which CLI flag and environment variable allow you to execute dbt commands when your current working directory is not the project root?

</front>

<back>

You can use the `--project-dir` CLI flag or the `DBT_PROJECT_DIR` environment variable to specify the path to the folder containing `dbt_project.yml`.

Example:
```bash
dbt run --project-dir /path/to/project
```

</back>
