<front>

You attempt to view your documentation locally by opening `target/index.html` directly in your browser, but the page loads indefinitely with a spinning logo. How should you fix this?

<back>

Browsers block local file access (CORS) required to load the JSON artifacts. You must either start a local web server or regenerate the docs as a single file:

Option 1 (Server):
```bash
dbt docs serve
```
Option 2 (Single File):
```bash
dbt docs generate --static
```
