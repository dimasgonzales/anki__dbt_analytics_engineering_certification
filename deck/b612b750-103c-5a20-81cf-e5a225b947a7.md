<front>

What is the default behavior regarding access modifiers for imported packages, and how do you enforce strict encapsulation?

</front>

<back>

By default, host projects can `ref()` any model in a package regardless of its access level (ignoring `private`/`protected`).

To enforce encapsulation, the package maintainer must set `restrict-access: True` in the package's `dbt_project.yml`, which forces the host to only reference `public` models.
