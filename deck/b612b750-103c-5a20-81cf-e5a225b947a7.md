  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer accurately reflects the default behavior of unrestricted model access in packages and the method to enforce encapsulation via restrict-access config, as detailed in the reference text."

    quote: "For this reason, model access restrictions are 'off' by default for models defined in packages. You can reference models from that package regardless of their `access` modifier. The project is installed as a package can optionally restrict external `ref` access to just its public models. The package maintainer does this by setting a `restrict-access` config to `True` in `dbt_project.yml`."

<front>

What is the default behavior regarding access modifiers for imported packages, and how do you enforce strict encapsulation?

<back>

By default, host projects can `ref()` any model in a package regardless of its access level (ignoring `private`/`protected`).

To enforce encapsulation, the package maintainer must set `restrict-access: True` in the package's `dbt_project.yml`, which forces the host to only reference `public` models.
