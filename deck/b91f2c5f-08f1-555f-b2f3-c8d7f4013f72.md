<front>

In `dbt_project.yml`, you configure `+group: marketing` for the `models/marts` folder. However, inside `models/marts/finance_v1.sql`, you include `{{ config(group='finance') }}`. Which group does the model belong to?

<back>

The model belongs to the **finance** group.

Specific configurations defined in the model file (or model properties YAML) take precedence over general configurations defined in `dbt_project.yml`.
