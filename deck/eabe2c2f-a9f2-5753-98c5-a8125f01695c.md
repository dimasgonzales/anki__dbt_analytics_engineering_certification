  verdict: SUPPORTED
  explanation: "The answer is supported by the Reference Text. It explicitly states that the default materialization is view. Additionally, the text advises using table materialization for models queried by BI tools or regularly, which aligns with the answer's claim about switching to table for faster performance with frequent queries."

What is the default materialization type in dbt, and what is the primary trigger to switch a model from 'view' to 'table'?

<back>

The default materialization is `view`. You should switch to `table` when downstream tools (like BI dashboards) query the model frequently and require faster query performance, as views calculate data on the fly every time they are queried.
