What is the default materialization type in dbt, and what is the primary trigger to switch a model from 'view' to 'table'?

The default materialization is `view`. You should switch to `table` when downstream tools (like BI dashboards) query the model frequently and require faster query performance, as views calculate data on the fly every time they are queried.
