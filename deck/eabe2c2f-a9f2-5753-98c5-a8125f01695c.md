  explanation: "The reference text explicitly supports that the default materialization is 'view' with the provided quote. However, it does not contain information about when to switch from 'view' to 'table' or the performance reasons mentioned in the answer, such as frequent queries by downstream tools, leaving the second part unverified."

What is the default materialization type in dbt, and what is the primary trigger to switch a model from 'view' to 'table'?

The default materialization is `view`. You should switch to `table` when downstream tools (like BI dashboards) query the model frequently and require faster query performance, as views calculate data on the fly every time they are queried.
