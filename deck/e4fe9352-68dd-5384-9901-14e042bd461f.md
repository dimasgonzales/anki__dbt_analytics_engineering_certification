<front>

A dbt Cloud job has 'Run source freshness' enabled in the UI settings (checkbox). During the run, a source fails the freshness check, but the subsequent `dbt run` command completes without error. What is the final status of the job?

<back>

The job status is **Success**.

Unlike adding `dbt source freshness` as a manual command step (which would force a job failure), the UI-checkbox version treats freshness failures as soft failures, allowing the job to succeed if the main commands pass.
