  explanation: "The reference text discusses profiles, profiles.yml, and the dbt_project.yml file separately, but does not contain any information about a 'profile' key within dbt_project.yml or its purpose as described in the answer. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to verify the answer."

<front>

What is the specific purpose of the `profile` key within the `dbt_project.yml` file?

<back>

The `profile` key acts as a bridge that links the project code to specific database credentials. It must match a profile name defined in the user's local `profiles.yml` file, telling dbt which connection details (host, user, password, warehouse) to use when running the project.
