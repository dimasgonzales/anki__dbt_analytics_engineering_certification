<front>

In dbt selector syntax, how does dbt interpret space-separated arguments versus comma-separated arguments within a single string?

</front>

<back>

dbt interprets the arguments as follows:
*   **Space-separated:** Acts as a **Union (OR)**.
*   **Comma-separated:** Acts as an **Intersection (AND)**.

Example:
`tag:daily,tag:finance` selects models with BOTH tags.
