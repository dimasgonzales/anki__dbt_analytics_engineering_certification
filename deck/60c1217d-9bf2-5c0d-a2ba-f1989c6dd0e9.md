  verdict: NOT_FOUND
  explanation: "The reference text explicitly supports the part of the answer regarding comma-separated arguments acting as Intersection (AND), but does not mention space-separated arguments at all. Therefore, the full answer, which includes interpretations for both space-separated and comma-separated arguments, cannot be fully verified from the provided text."
  citation:
    quote: "separating them with commas (`,`) without whitespace (for example, `dbt run --select \"marts.finance,tag:nightly\"`). This only selects resources that satisfy *all* arguments."

<front>

In dbt selector syntax, how does dbt interpret space-separated arguments versus comma-separated arguments within a single string?

</front>

---

<back>

dbt interprets the arguments as follows:
*   **Space-separated:** Acts as a **Union (OR)**.
*   **Comma-separated:** Acts as an **Intersection (AND)**.

Example:
`tag:daily,tag:finance` selects models with BOTH tags.
