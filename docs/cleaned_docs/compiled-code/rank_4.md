About target variables
======================

The `target` variable contains information about your connection to the warehouse.

* **dbt Core:** These values are based on the target defined in your [profiles.yml](/docs/core/connect-data-platform/profiles.yml) file. Please note that for certain adapters, additional configuration steps may be required. Refer to the [set up page](/docs/core/connect-data-platform/about-core-connections) for your data platform.
* **dbt** To learn more about setting up your adapter in dbt, refer to [About data platform connections](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/about-connections).
  + **[Orchestrator](/docs/deploy/job-scheduler)**: `target.name` is defined per job as described in [Custom target names](/docs/build/custom-target-names). For other attributes, values are defined by the deployment connection. To check these values, click **Deploy** and select **Environments**. Then, select the relevant deployment environment, and click **Settings**.
  + **[Studio IDE](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/develop-in-the-cloud)**: These values are defined by your connection and credentials. To edit these values, click on your account name in the left side menu and select **Account settings**. Then, click **Credentials**. Select and edit a project to set up the credentials and target name.

Some configurations are shared between all adapters, while others are adapter-specific.

### Use `target.name` to limit data in dev[​](#use-targetname-to-limit-data-in-dev "Direct link to use-targetname-to-limit-data-in-dev")

As long as you use sensible target names, you can perform conditional logic to limit data when working in dev.

```
select  
  *  
from source('web_events', 'page_views')  
{% if target.name == 'dev' %}  
where created_at >= dateadd('day', -3, current_date)  
{% endif %}
```

### Use `target.name` to change your source database[​](#use-targetname-to-change-your-source-database "Direct link to use-targetname-to-change-your-source-database")

If you have specific Snowflake databases configured for your dev/qa/prod environments,
you can set up your sources to compile to different databases depending on your
environment.

```
sources:  
  - name: source_name   
    database: |  
      {%- if  target.name == "dev" -%} raw_dev  
      {%- elif target.name == "qa"  -%} raw_qa  
      {%- elif target.name == "prod"  -%} raw_prod  
      {%- else -%} invalid_database  
      {%- endif -%}  
    schema: source_schema
```
