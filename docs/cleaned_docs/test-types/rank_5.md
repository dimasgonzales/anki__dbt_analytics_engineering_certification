Can I test the uniqueness of two columns?
=========================================

Yes, there's a few different options.

Consider an orders table that contains records from multiple countries, and the combination of ID and country code is unique:

| order\_id | country\_code |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | AU |
| 2 | AU |
| ... | ... |
| 1 | US |
| 2 | US |
| ... | ... |

Here are some approaches:

#### 1. Create a unique key in the model and test that[​](#1-create-a-unique-key-in-the-model-and-test-that "Direct link to 1. Create a unique key in the model and test that")

models/orders.sql

```
select  
  country_code || '-' || order_id as surrogate_key,  
  ...
```

models/orders.yml

```
version: 2  
  
models:  
  - name: orders  
    columns:  
      - name: surrogate_key  
        data_tests:  
          - unique
```

#### 2. Test an expression[​](#2-test-an-expression "Direct link to 2. Test an expression")

models/orders.yml

```
version: 2  
  
models:  
  - name: orders  
    data_tests:  
      - unique:  
          arguments: # available in v1.10.5 and higher. Older versions can set the <argument_name> as the top-level property.  
            column_name: "(country_code || '-' || order_id)"
```

#### 3. Use the `dbt_utils.unique_combination_of_columns` test[​](#3-use-the-dbt_utilsunique_combination_of_columns-test "Direct link to 3-use-the-dbt_utilsunique_combination_of_columns-test")

This is especially useful for large datasets since it is more performant. Check out the docs on [packages](/docs/build/packages) for more information.

models/orders.yml

```
version: 2  
  
models:  
  - name: orders  
    data_tests:  
      - dbt_utils.unique_combination_of_columns:  
          arguments: # available in v1.10.5 and higher. Older versions can set the <argument_name> as the top-level property.  
            combination_of_columns:  
              - country_code  
              - order_id
```
