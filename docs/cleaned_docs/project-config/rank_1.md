dbt\_project.yml
================

The dbt\_project.yml file is a required file for all dbt projects. It contains important information that tells dbt how to operate your project.

Every [dbt project](/docs/build/projects) needs a `dbt_project.yml` file — this is how dbt knows a directory is a dbt project. It also contains important information that tells dbt how to operate your project. It works as follows:

* dbt uses [YAML](https://yaml.org/) in a few different places. If you're new to YAML, it would be worth learning how arrays, dictionaries, and strings are represented.
* By default, dbt looks for the `dbt_project.yml` in your current working directory and its parents, but you can set a different directory using the `--project-dir` flag or the `DBT_PROJECT_DIR` environment variable.
* Specify your dbt project ID in the `dbt_project.yml` file using `project-id` under the `dbt-cloud` config. Find your project ID in your dbt project URL: For example, in `https://YOUR_ACCESS_URL/11/projects/123456`, the project ID is `123456`.
* Note, you can't set up a "property" in the `dbt_project.yml` file if it's not a config (an example is [macros](/reference/macro-properties)). This applies to all types of resources. Refer to [Configs and properties](/reference/configs-and-properties) for more detail.

The following example is a list of all available configurations in the `dbt_project.yml` file:

The `+` prefix[​](#the--prefix "Direct link to the--prefix")
------------------------------------------------------------

dbt demarcates between a folder name and a configuration by using a `+` prefix before the configuration name. The `+` prefix is used for configs *only* and applies to `dbt_project.yml` under the corresponding resource key. It doesn't apply to:

* `config()` Jinja macro within a resource file
* config property in a `.yml` file.

For more info, see the [Using the `+` prefix](/reference/resource-configs/plus-prefix).

Naming convention[​](#naming-convention "Direct link to Naming convention")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's important to follow the correct YAML naming conventions for the configs in your `dbt_project.yml` file to ensure dbt can process them properly. This is especially true for resource types with more than one word.

* Use dashes (`-`) when configuring resource types with multiple words in your `dbt_project.yml` file. Here's an example for [saved queries](/docs/build/saved-queries#configure-saved-query):

  dbt\_project.yml

  ```
  saved-queries:  # Use dashes for resource types in the dbt_project.yml file.  
    my_saved_query:  
      +cache:  
        enabled: true
  ```
* Use underscore (`_`) when configuring resource types with multiple words for YAML files other than the `dbt_project.yml` file. For example, here's the same saved queries resource in the `semantic_models.yml` file:

  models/semantic\_models.yml

  ```
  saved_queries:  # Use underscores everywhere outside the dbt_project.yml file.  
    - name: saved_query_name  
      ... # Rest of the saved queries configuration.  
      config:  
        cache:  
          enabled: true
  ```
