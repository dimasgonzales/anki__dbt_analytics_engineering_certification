What version of Python can I use?
=================================

Use this table to match dbt Core versions with their compatible Python versions. New [dbt minor versions](/docs/dbt-versions/core#minor-versions) will add support for new Python3 minor versions when all dependencies can support it. In addition, dbt minor versions will withdraw support for old Python3 minor versions before their [end of life](https://endoflife.date/python).

| dbt-core version | v1.11 | v1.10 | v1.9 | v1.8 | v1.7 | v1.6 | v1.5 | v1.4 | v1.3 | v1.2 | v1.1 | v1.0 |

| Python 3.13 | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

⚠️ Python 3.13 is supported in dbt Core v1.10 for the Postgres adapter, with official support for more adapters coming soon.

Adapter plugins and their dependencies are not always compatible with the latest version of Python.

Note that this shouldn't be confused with [dbt Python models](/docs/build/python-models#specific-data-platforms). If you're using a data platform that supports Snowpark, use the `python_version` config to run a Snowpark model with [Python versions](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/python/setup) 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11.
