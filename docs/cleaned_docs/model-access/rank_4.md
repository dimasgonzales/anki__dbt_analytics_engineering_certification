About model object
==================

`model` is the dbt [graph object](/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/graph) (or node) for the current model. It can be used to:

* Access `config` settings, say, in a post-hook
* Access the path to the model

For example:

```
{% if model.config.materialized == 'view' %}  
  {{ log(model.name ~ " is a view.", info=True) }}  
{% endif %}
```

To view the contents of `model` for a given model:

* Command line interface
* Studio IDE

If you're using the command line interface (CLI), use [log()](/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/log) to print the full contents:

```
{{ log(model, info=True) }}
```

If you're using the Studio IDE, compile the following to print the full contents:

```
{{ model | tojson(indent = 4) }}
```

Batch properties for microbatch models[​](#batch-properties-for-microbatch-models "Direct link to Batch properties for microbatch models")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting in dbt Core v1.9, the model object includes a `batch` property (`model.batch`), which provides details about the current batch when executing an [incremental microbatch](/docs/build/incremental-microbatch) model. This property is only populated during the batch execution of a microbatch model.

The following table describes the properties of the `batch` object. Note that dbt appends the property to the `model` and `batch` objects.

| Property | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | The unique identifier for the batch within the context of the microbatch model. | `model.batch.id` |
| `event_time_start` | The start time of the batch's [`event_time`](/reference/resource-configs/event-time) filter (inclusive). | `model.batch.event_time_start` |
| `event_time_end` | The end time of the batch's `event_time` filter (exclusive). | `model.batch.event_time_end` |

### Usage notes[​](#usage-notes "Direct link to Usage notes")

`model.batch` is only available during the execution of a microbatch model batch. Outside of the microbatch execution, `model.batch` is `None`, and its sub-properties aren't accessible.

#### Example of safeguarding access to batch properties[​](#example-of-safeguarding-access-to-batch-properties "Direct link to Example of safeguarding access to batch properties")

We recommend to always check if `model.batch` is populated before accessing its properties. To do this, use an `if` statement for safe access to `batch` properties:

```
{% if model.batch %}  
  {{ log(model.batch.id) }}  # Log the batch ID #  
  {{ log(model.batch.event_time_start) }}  # Log the start time of the batch #  
  {{ log(model.batch.event_time_end) }}  # Log the end time of the batch #  
{% endif %}
```

In this example, the `if model.batch` statement makes sure that the code only runs during a batch execution. `log()` is used to print the `batch` properties for debugging.

#### Example of log batch details[​](#example-of-log-batch-details "Direct link to Example of log batch details")

This is a practical example of how you might use `model.batch` in a microbatch model to log batch details for the `batch.id`:

```
{% if model.batch %}  
  {{ log("Processing batch with ID: " ~ model.batch.id, info=True) }}  
  {{ log("Batch event time range: " ~ model.batch.event_time_start ~ " to " ~ model.batch.event_time_end, info=True) }}  
{% endif %}
```

In this example, the `if model.batch` statement makes sure that the code only runs during a batch execution. `log()` is used to print the `batch` properties for debugging.

Model structure and JSON schema[​](#model-structure-and-json-schema "Direct link to Model structure and JSON schema")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To view the structure of `models` and their definitions:

* Refer to [dbt JSON Schema](https://schemas.getdbt.com/) for describing and consuming dbt generated artifacts
* Select the corresponding manifest version under **Manifest**. For example if you're on dbt v1.8, then you would select Manifest v12
  + The `manifest.json` version number is related to (but not *equal* to) your dbt version, so you *must* use the correct `manifest.json` version for your dbt version. To find the correct `manifest.json` version, refer to [Manifest](/reference/artifacts/manifest-json) and select the dbt version on the top navigation (such as `v1.5`). This will help you find out which tags are associated with your model.
* Then go to `nodes` --> Select Additional properties --> `CompiledModelNode` or view other definitions/objects.

Use the following table to understand how the versioning pattern works and match the Manifest version with the dbt version:

| dbt version | Manifest version |
| --- | --- |
| dbt Fusion Engine v2.0 | v20 (Identical to [v12](https://schemas.getdbt.com/dbt/manifest/v12/index.html)) |
| Core v1.11 | [v12](https://schemas.getdbt.com/dbt/manifest/v12/index.html) |
| Core v1.10 | [v12](https://schemas.getdbt.com/dbt/manifest/v12/index.html) |
| Core v1.9 | [v12](https://schemas.getdbt.com/dbt/manifest/v12/index.html) |
| Core v1.8 | [v12](https://schemas.getdbt.com/dbt/manifest/v12/index.html) |
| Core v1.7 | [v11](https://schemas.getdbt.com/dbt/manifest/v11/index.html) |
| Core v1.6 | [v10](https://schemas.getdbt.com/dbt/manifest/v10/index.html) |
| Core v1.5 | [v9](https://schemas.getdbt.com/dbt/manifest/v9/index.html) |
| Core v1.4 | [v8](https://schemas.getdbt.com/dbt/manifest/v8/index.html) |
| Core v1.3 | [v7](https://schemas.getdbt.com/dbt/manifest/v7/index.html) |
