About run\_query macro
======================

The `run_query` macro provides a convenient way to run queries and fetch their results. It is a wrapper around the [statement block](/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/statement-blocks), which is more flexible, but also more complicated to use.

**Args**:

* `sql`: The SQL query to execute

Returns a [Table](https://agate.readthedocs.io/page/api/table.html) object with the result of the query. If the specified query does not return results (eg. a DDL, DML, or maintenance query), then the return value will be `none`.

**Note:** The `run_query` macro will not begin a transaction automatically - if you wish to run your query inside of a transaction, please use `begin` and `commit`  statements as appropriate.

Using run\_query for the first time?

Check out the section of the Getting Started guide on [using Jinja](/guides/using-jinja#dynamically-retrieve-the-list-of-payment-methods) for an example of working with the results of the `run_query` macro!

**Example Usage:**

models/my\_model.sql

```
{% set results = run_query('select 1 as id') %}  
  
{% if results is not none %}  
  {{ log(results.print_table(), info=True) }}  
{% endif %}  
  
{# do something with `results` here... #}
```

macros/run\_grants.sql

```
{% macro run_vacuum(table) %}  
  
  {% set query %}  
    vacuum table {{ table }}  
  {% endset %}  
  
  {% do run_query(query) %}  
{% endmacro %}
```

Here's an example of using this (though if you're using `run_query` to return the values of a column, check out the [get\_column\_values](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils#get_column_values-source) macro in the dbt-utils package).

models/my\_model.sql

```
{% set payment_methods_query %}  
select distinct payment_method from app_data.payments  
order by 1  
{% endset %}  
  
{% set results = run_query(payment_methods_query) %}  
  
{% if execute %}  
{# Return the first column #}  
{% set results_list = results.columns[0].values() %}  
{% else %}  
{% set results_list = [] %}  
{% endif %}  
  
select  
order_id,  
{% for payment_method in results_list %}  
sum(case when payment_method = '{{ payment_method }}' then amount end) as {{ payment_method }}_amount,  
{% endfor %}  
sum(amount) as total_amount  
from {{ ref('raw_payments') }}  
group by 1
```

You can also use `run_query` to perform SQL queries that aren't select statements.

macros/run\_vacuum.sql

```
{% macro run_vacuum(table) %}  
  
  {% set query %}  
    vacuum table {{ table }}  
  {% endset %}  
  
  {% do run_query(query) %}  
{% endmacro %}
```

Use the `length` filter to verify whether `run_query` returned any rows or not. Make sure to wrap the logic in an [if execute](/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/execute) block to avoid unexpected behavior during parsing.

```
{% if execute %}  
{% set results = run_query(payment_methods_query) %}  
{% if results|length > 0 %}  
  	-- do something with `results` here...  
{% else %}  
    -- do fallback here...  
{% endif %}  
{% endif %}
```
