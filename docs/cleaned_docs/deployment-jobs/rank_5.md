Jobs in the dbt platform
========================

These are the available job types in dbt:

The following comparison table describes the behaviors of the different job types:

|  | **Deploy jobs** | **CI jobs** | **Merge jobs** | **State-aware jobs** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Purpose | Builds production data assets. | Builds and tests new code before merging changes into production. | Build merged changes into production or update state for deferral. | Trigger model builds and job runs only when source data is updated. |
| Trigger types | Triggered by a schedule, API, or the successful completion of another job. | Triggered by a commit to a PR or by API. | Triggered by a successful merge into the environment's branch or by API. | Triggered when code, sources, or upstream data changes and at custom refresh intervals and for custom source freshness configurations |
| Destination | Builds into a production database and schema. | Builds into a staging database and ephemeral schema, lived for the lifetime of the PR. | Builds into a production database and schema. | Builds into a production database and schema. |
| Execution mode | Runs execute sequentially, so as to not have collisions on the underlying DAG. | Runs execute in parallel to promote team velocity. | Runs execute sequentially, so as to not have collisions on the underlying DAG. |  |
| Efficiency run savings | Detects over-scheduled jobs and cancels unnecessary runs to avoid queue clog. | Cancels existing runs when a newer commit is pushed to avoid redundant work. | N/A | Runs jobs and build models *only* when source data is updated or if models are older than what you specified in the project refresh interval |
| State comparison | Only sometimes needs to detect state. | Almost always needs to compare state against the production environment to build on modified code and its dependents. | Almost always needs to compare state against the production environment to build on modified code and its dependents. |  |
| Job run duration | Limit is 24 hours. | Limit is 24 hours. | Limit is 24 hours. | Limit is 24 hours. |
