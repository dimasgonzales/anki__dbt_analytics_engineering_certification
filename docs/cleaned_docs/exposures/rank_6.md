Exposures object schema
=======================

[Exposures](/docs/build/exposures) are dbt resources that represent downstream uses of your project, such as dashboards, applications, or data science pipelines. You can query exposures through the Discovery API to understand which assets depend on your models.

The [Example query](#example-query) illustrates a few fields you can query with the `exposures` object. Refer to [Fields](#fields) to view the entire schema, which provides all possible fields you can query.

### Example query[​](#example-query "Direct link to Example query")

You can specify the `environmentId`, `first: 100`, and filter by model `uniqueIds` to return all the downstream exposures (dashboards, applications, etc.) that depend on the `customers` model in the `marketing` package, limited to the first 100 results:

```
query {  
  environment(id: 834) {  
    applied {  
      exposures(  
        filter: {  
          uniqueIds: ["model.marketing.customers"] # Use this format for unique ID: RESOURCE_TYPE.PACKAGE_NAME.RESOURCE_NAME  
        },   
        first: 100  
      ) {  
        edges {  
          node {  
            accountId  
            exposureType  
            fqn  
            projectId
