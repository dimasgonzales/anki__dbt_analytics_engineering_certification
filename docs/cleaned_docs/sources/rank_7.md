Sources JSON file
=================

**Current schema:** [`v3`](https://schemas.getdbt.com/dbt/sources/v3/index.html)

**Produced by:** [`source freshness`](/reference/commands/source)

This file contains information about [sources with freshness checks](/docs/build/sources#checking-source-freshness). Today, dbt uses this file to power its [Source Freshness visualization](/docs/build/sources#source-data-freshness).

### Top-level keys[​](#top-level-keys "Direct link to Top-level keys")

* `elapsed_time`: Total invocation time in seconds.
* `results`: Array of freshness-check execution details.

Each entry in `results` is a dictionary with the following keys:

* `unique_id`: Unique source node identifier, which map results to `sources` in the [manifest](/reference/artifacts/manifest-json)
* `max_loaded_at`: Max value of `loaded_at_field` timestamp in the source table when queried.
* `snapshotted_at`: Current timestamp when querying.
* `max_loaded_at_time_ago_in_s`: Interval between `max_loaded_at` and `snapshotted_at`, calculated in python to handle timezone complexity.
* `criteria`: The freshness threshold(s) for this source, defined in the project.
* `status`: The freshness status of this source, based on `max_loaded_at_time_ago_in_s` + `criteria`, reported on the CLI. One of `pass`, `warn`, or `error` if the query succeeds, `runtime error` if the query fails.
* `execution_time`: Total time spent checking freshness for this source
* `timing`: Array that breaks down execution time into steps (`compile` + `execute`)

* `adapter_response`: Dictionary of metadata returned from the database, which varies by adapter. For example, success `code`, number of `rows_affected`, total `bytes_processed`, and so on. Not applicable for [data tests](/docs/build/data-tests).
  + `rows_affected` returns the number of rows modified by the last statement executed. In cases where the query's row count can't be determined or isn't applicable (such as when creating a view), a [standard value](https://peps.python.org/pep-0249/#rowcount) of `-1` is returned for `rowcount`.
