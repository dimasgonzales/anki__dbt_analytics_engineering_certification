Configuring quoting in sources
==============================

models/<filename>.yml

```
sources:  
  - name: jaffle_shop  
    quoting:  
      database: true | false  
      schema: true | false  
      identifier: true | false  
    tables:  
      - name: orders  
        quoting:  
          database: true | false  
          schema: true | false  
          identifier: true | false
```

Definition[​](#definition "Direct link to Definition")
------------------------------------------------------

Optionally configure whether dbt should quote databases, schemas, and identifiers when resolving a `{{ source() }}` function to a direct relation reference.

This config can be specified for all tables in a source, or for a specific source tableIn simplest terms, a table is the direct storage of data in rows and columns. Think excel sheet with raw values in each of the cells.. Quoting configs defined for a specific source table override the quoting configs specified for the top-level source.

BigQuery Terminology

Note that for BigQuery quoting configuration, `database` and `schema` should be used here, though these configs will apply to `project` and `dataset` names respectively

Default[​](#default "Direct link to Default")
---------------------------------------------

The default values vary by database.

For most adapters, quoting is set to *true* by default.

Why? It's equally easy to select from relations with quoted or unquoted identifiers. Quoting allows you to use reserved words and special characters in those identifiers, though we recommend avoiding this whenever possible.

On Snowflake, quoting is set to *false* by default.

Creating relations with quoted identifiers also makes those identifiers case sensitive. It's much more difficult to select from them. You can re-enable quoting for relations identifiers that are case sensitive, reserved words, or contain special characters, but we recommend you avoid this as much as possible.

Example[​](#example "Direct link to Example")
---------------------------------------------

models/<filename>.yml

```
sources:  
  - name: jaffle_shop  
    database: raw  
    quoting:  
      database: true  
      schema: true  
      identifier: true  
  
    tables:  
      - name: orders  
      - name: customers  
        # This overrides the `jaffle_shop` quoting config  
        quoting:  
          identifier: false
```

In a downstream model:

models/<filename>.yml

```
select  
  ...  
  
-- this should be quoted  
from {{ source('jaffle_shop', 'orders') }}  
  
-- here, the identifier should be unquoted  
left join {{ source('jaffle_shop', 'customers') }} using (order_id)
```

This will get compiled to:

```
select  
  ...  
  
-- this should be quoted  
from "raw"."jaffle_shop"."orders"  
  
-- here, the identifier should be unquoted  
left join "raw"."jaffle_shop".customers using (order_id)
```
