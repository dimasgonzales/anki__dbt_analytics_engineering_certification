Introduction[​](#introduction "Direct link to Introduction")
------------------------------------------------------------

Unlock the power of [Catalog](/docs/explore/explore-projects) in this hands-on workshop designed for analytics engineers, data analysts, stakeholders, and data leaders.

This quickstart guide accompanies the Catalog hands-on workshop and helps you dive into a production-level Mesh implementation and discover how to explore your data workflows.⁠ Whether you're looking to streamline your data operations, improve data quality, or self-serve information about your data platform, this workshop will equip you with the tools and knowledge to take your dbt projects to the next level.

By the end of the guide and workshop, you'll understand how to leverage Catalog and have the confidence to navigate multiple dbt projects, trace dependencies, and identify opportunities to improve performance and data quality.

### What you'll learn[​](#what-youll-learn "Direct link to What you'll learn")

In this guide, you will learn how to:

Setup[​](#setup "Direct link to Setup")
---------------------------------------

Now we’ll be creating your dbt account and connecting it to a data warehouse.

1. Go to this URL (sign out if you're already logged in): <https://cloud.getdbt.com/coalesce-workshop-signup>
2. Enter your first name and last name.
3. Select the **Exploring a Mesh implementation with Catalog** option.
4. Use the passcode provided by the workshop facilitator.
5. Agree to the terms of service and click the **Complete Registration** button.
6. Wait about 30 seconds, you’ll be in the dbt account for this workshop and already connected to a data warehouse.
7. Toggle into the **Platform project**. Go to the **Orchestration** tab and select **Jobs** from the dropdown menu.
8. Run each job you see by clicking on the job and then selecting **Run now**. This will run the *upstream* project job in both a production and staging environment.
9. Toggle into the **Analytics project**. Go to the **Orchestration** tab and select **Jobs** from the dropdown menu.
10. Run each job you see by clicking on the job and then selecting **Run now**. This will run the *downstream* project job in both a production and staging environment.

Performance[​](#performance "Direct link to Performance")
---------------------------------------------------------

[![dbt Catalog's Performance tab](/img/quickstarts/dbt-cloud/explorer_performance_tab.png?v=2 "dbt Catalog's Performance tab")](#)dbt Catalog's Performance tab

Catalog will show you your project's most executed models, longest model executions, most failed models and tests, and most consumed models all in one place: The performance tab.

### Hands-On[​](#hands-on "Direct link to Hands-On")

* Trigger the Daily Prod job to run again.
* Explore the **Performance** tab on the **Project details** page.
  + Which model took the longest over the last two weeks? Over the last month?
  + Which model failed the most tests?
  + Click on the model that took the longest to run in the *Longest model executions* graph.
    - What is the average duration time over the last two weeks? Over the last month?
    - How often is the model being built? What is the Model Test Failure Rate?

Resources[​](#resources "Direct link to Resources")
---------------------------------------------------

With Catalog, you can view your project's resources (such as models, tests, and metrics), their lineage, and model consumption to gain a better understanding of its latest production state.

Navigate and manage your projects within dbt to help you and other data developers, analysts, and consumers discover and leverage your dbt resources.

### Hands-On[​](#hands-on-1 "Direct link to Hands-On")

* Explore the **Model** tab
  + Pick a model. What’s its row count?
  + Use the test results drop down to see if this model’s tests passed. What other models does it depend on?
* Explore the **Tests** tab
  + What tests do we see? Which tests have warnings? Failures?
* Explore the **Sources** tab
  + What sources can we see? Which sources have stale data? Which sources have fresh data?
* Explore **Exposures**
  + Use the lineage graph to find an exposure. Which models and metrics does the Exposure reference?

Lineage[​](#lineage "Direct link to Lineage")
---------------------------------------------

Catalog provides a visualization of your project’s DAG that you can interact with. The nodes in the lineage graph represent the project’s resources and the edges represent the relationships between the nodes. Nodes are color-coded and include iconography according to their resource type.

* Use the search bar and [node selectors](/reference/node-selection/syntax) to filter your DAG.
* [Lenses](/docs/explore/explore-projects#lenses) make it easier to understand your project’s contextual metadata at scales, especially to distinguish a particular model or a subset of models.
  + Applying a lens adds tags to the nodes, showing metadata like layer values, with color coding to help you distinguish them.

[![dbt Catalog's lineage graph](/img/quickstarts/dbt-cloud/dbt_explorer_dag.png?v=2 "dbt Catalog's lineage graph")](#)dbt Catalog's lineage graph

* Use the [advanced search](/docs/explore/explore-projects#search-resources) feature to locate resources in your project.
  + Perform hard searches and keyword searches.
  + All resource names, column names, resource descriptions, warehouse relations, and code matching your search criteria will appear in the center of the page.
  + Apply filters to fully refine your search.
* When searching for a column name, the results show all relational nodes containing that column in their schemas.

### Hands-On[​](#hands-on-2 "Direct link to Hands-On")

* Explore **Project-Level lineage**
  + Pick a model and review its upstream and downstream dependencies
  + Which sources does this model depend on? Which models depend on this model?
* Explore **Lenses**
  + Apply the Test Status Lenses. Which models passed tests? Which had warnings?
  + Explore different lenses (Model Layer, Materialization Type, Resource). What information do you see?
* Explore **Column-Level Lineage**
  + Navigate to the model’s **Model resource** page and explore the primary key column’s **Column-Level Lineage**

Multi-project[​](#multi-project "Direct link to Multi-project")
---------------------------------------------------------------

Use Catalog to gain a deeper understanding of *all* your dbt projects with its [multi-project capabilities](/docs/explore/explore-multiple-projects).

* See the number of public, protected, and private models, as well as metrics for each project.
* View cross-project lineage and navigate between individual projects’ lineage graphs.
* Explore column-level lineage across projects.

### Hands-On[​](#hands-on-3 "Direct link to Hands-On")

* In the lineage graph, filter the Platform Project’s Project-Level Lineage for Public models using the `access:public` filter
  + Make a note of which models are referenced by the analytics project.
* Explore the Analytics Project’s lineage
  + Choose a model in the Platform project referenced by the Analytics project.
  + Look at the multi-project column-level lineage of its primary key column.
  + Open the Analytics project’s lineage graph. Which models does it reference?

Project recommendations[​](#project-recommendations "Direct link to Project recommendations")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These recommendations are designed to build trust in your project and reduce confusion.

To learn more about the specific suggestions and the reasons behind them, check out [our docs](/docs/explore/project-recommendations).

### Hands-On[​](#hands-on-4 "Direct link to Hands-On")

* Review your project recommendations.
* Find the project recommendation for the model `agg_daily_returned_orders`.
* Add documentation to this model in the `aggregates.yml` file.
