How do I set a datatype for a column in my seed?
================================================

dbt will infer the datatype for each column based on the data in your CSV.

You can also explicitly set a datatype using the `column_types` [configuration](/reference/resource-configs/column_types) like so:

dbt\_project.yml

```
seeds:  
  jaffle_shop: # you must include the project name  
    warehouse_locations:  
      +column_types:  
        zipcode: varchar(5)
```
