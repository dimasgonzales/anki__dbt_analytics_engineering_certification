Seed configurations
===================

Available configurations[​](#available-configurations "Direct link to Available configurations")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Seed-specific configurations[​](#seed-specific-configurations "Direct link to Seed-specific configurations")

Resource-specific configurations are applicable to only one dbt resource type rather than multiple resource types. You can define these settings in the project file (`dbt_project.yml`), a property file (`models/properties.yml` for models, similarly for other resources), or within the resource’s file using the `{{ config() }}` macro.

The following resource-specific configurations are only available to Seeds:

* Project file
* Property file

dbt\_project.yml

```
seeds:  
  <resource-path>:  
    +quote_columns: true | false  
    +column_types: {column_name: datatype}  
    +delimiter: <string>
```

seeds/properties.yml

```
seeds:  
  - name: [<seed-name>]  
    config:  
      quote_columns: true | false  
      column_types: {column_name: datatype}  
      delimiter: <string>
```

### General configurations[​](#general-configurations "Direct link to General configurations")

General configurations provide broader operational settings applicable across multiple resource types. Like resource-specific configurations, these can also be set in the project file, property files, or within resource-specific files.

* Project file
* Property file

dbt\_project.yml

seeds/properties.yml

Configuring seeds[​](#configuring-seeds "Direct link to Configuring seeds")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Seeds can only be configured from YAML files, either in `dbt_project.yml` or within an individual seed's YAML properties. It is not possible to configure a seed from within its CSV file.

Seed configurations, like model configurations, are applied hierarchically — configurations applied to a `marketing` subdirectory will take precedence over configurations applied to the entire `jaffle_shop` project, and configurations defined in a specific seed's properties will override configurations defined in `dbt_project.yml`.

### Examples[​](#examples "Direct link to Examples")

#### Apply the `schema` configuration to all seeds[​](#apply-the-schema-configuration-to-all-seeds "Direct link to apply-the-schema-configuration-to-all-seeds")

To apply a configuration to all seeds, including those in any installed [packages](/docs/build/packages), nest the configuration directly under the `seeds` key:

dbt\_project.yml

```
seeds:  
  +schema: seed_data
```

#### Apply the `schema` configuration to all seeds in your project[​](#apply-the-schema-configuration-to-all-seeds-in-your-project "Direct link to apply-the-schema-configuration-to-all-seeds-in-your-project")

To apply a configuration to all seeds in your project only (i.e. *excluding* any seeds in installed packages), provide your [project name](/reference/project-configs/name) as part of the resource path.

For a project named `jaffle_shop`:

dbt\_project.yml

```
seeds:  
  jaffle_shop:  
    +schema: seed_data
```

Similarly, you can use the name of an installed package to configure seeds in that package.

#### Apply the `schema` configuration to one seed only[​](#apply-the-schema-configuration-to-one-seed-only "Direct link to apply-the-schema-configuration-to-one-seed-only")

To apply a configuration to one seed only, provide the full resource path (including the project name, and subdirectories).

seeds/marketing/properties.yml

```
seeds:  
  - name: utm_parameters  
    config:  
      schema: seed_data
```

In older versions of dbt, you must define configurations in `dbt_project.yml` and include the full resource path (including the project name, and subdirectories). For a project named `jaffle_shop`, with a seed file at `seeds/marketing/utm_parameters.csv`, this would look like:

dbt\_project.yml

```
seeds:  
  jaffle_shop:  
    marketing:  
      utm_parameters:  
        +schema: seed_data
```

Example seed configuration[​](#example-seed-configuration "Direct link to Example seed configuration")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following is a valid seed configuration for a project with:

* `name: jaffle_shop`
* A seed file at `seeds/country_codes.csv`, and
* A seed file at `seeds/marketing/utm_parameters.csv`

dbt\_project.yml

```
name: jaffle_shop  
...  
seeds:  
  jaffle_shop:  
    +enabled: true  
    +schema: seed_data  
    # This configures seeds/country_codes.csv  
    country_codes:  
      # Override column types  
      +column_types:  
        country_code: varchar(2)  
        country_name: varchar(32)  
    marketing:  
      +schema: marketing # this will take precedence
```
