💡Did you know...

Available from dbt v1.7 or with the [dbt "Latest" release track](/docs/dbt-versions/cloud-release-tracks).

Definition[​](#definition "Direct link to Definition")
------------------------------------------------------

You can use this optional seed configuration to customize how you separate values in a [seed](/docs/build/seeds) by providing the one-character string.

* The delimiter defaults to a comma when not specified.
* Explicitly set the `delimiter` configuration value if you want seed files to use a different delimiter, such as "|" or ";".

Usage[​](#usage "Direct link to Usage")
---------------------------------------

Specify a delimiter in your `dbt_project.yml` file to customize the global separator for all seed values:

dbt\_project.yml

```
seeds:  
  <project_name>:  
     +delimiter: "|" # default project delimiter for seeds will be "|"  
    <seed_subdirectory>:  
      +delimiter: "," # delimiter for seeds in seed_subdirectory will be ","
```

Or use a custom delimiter to override the values for a specific seed:

seeds/properties.yml

```
seeds:  
  - name: <seed_name>  
    config:   
      delimiter: "|"
```

Examples[​](#examples "Direct link to Examples")
------------------------------------------------

For a project with:

* `name: jaffle_shop` in the `dbt_project.yml` file
* `seed-paths: ["seeds"]` in the `dbt_project.yml` file

### Use a custom delimiter to override global values[​](#use-a-custom-delimiter-to-override-global-values "Direct link to Use a custom delimiter to override global values")

You can set a default behavior for all seeds with an exception for one seed, `seed_a`, which uses a comma:

dbt\_project.yml

```
seeds:  
  jaffle_shop:   
    +delimiter: "|" # default delimiter for seeds in jaffle_shop project will be "|"  
    seed_a:  
      +delimiter: "," # delimiter for seed_a will be ","
```

Your corresponding seed files would be formatted like this:

seeds/my\_seed.csv

```
col_a|col_b|col_c  
1|2|3  
4|5|6  
...
```

seeds/seed\_a.csv

```
name,id  
luna,1  
doug,2  
...
```

Or you can configure custom behavior for one seed. The `country_codes` uses the ";" delimiter:

seeds/properties.yml

```
seeds:  
  - name: country_codes  
    config:  
      delimiter: ";"
```

The `country_codes` seed file would be formatted like this:

seeds/country\_codes.csv

```
country_code;country_name  
US;United States  
CA;Canada  
GB;United Kingdom  
...
```
