About dbt run-operation command
===============================

### Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

The `dbt run-operation` command is used to invoke a macro. For usage information, consult the docs on [operations](/docs/build/hooks-operations#about-operations).

### Usage[​](#usage "Direct link to Usage")

```
$ dbt run-operation {macro} --args '{args}'  
  {macro}        Specify the macro to invoke. dbt will call this macro  
                        with the supplied arguments and then exit  
  --args ARGS           Supply arguments to the macro. This dictionary will be  
                        mapped to the keyword arguments defined in the  
                        selected macro. This argument should be a YAML string,  
                        eg. '{my_variable: my_value}'
```
