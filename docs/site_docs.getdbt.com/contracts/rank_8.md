Introduction[​](#introduction "Direct link to Introduction")
------------------------------------------------------------

Mesh is a framework that helps organizations scale their teams and data assets effectively. It promotes governance best practices and breaks large projects into manageable sections — for faster data development. Mesh is available for [dbt Enterprise](https://www.getdbt.com/) accounts.

This guide will teach you how to set up a multi-project design using foundational concepts of [Mesh](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/what-is-data-mesh-the-definition-and-importance-of-data-mesh) and how to implement a data mesh in dbt:

* Set up a foundational project called “Jaffle | Data Analytics”
* Set up a downstream project called “Jaffle | Finance”
* Add model access, versions, and contracts
* Set up a dbt job that is triggered on completion of an upstream job

For more information on why data mesh is important, read this post: [What is data mesh? The definition and importance of data mesh](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/what-is-data-mesh-the-definition-and-importance-of-data-mesh).

Prerequisites​[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites​")
-----------------------------------------------------------------

To leverage Mesh, you need the following:

* You must have a [dbt Enterprise-tier account](https://www.getdbt.com/get-started/enterprise-contact-pricing) [Enterprise](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")[Enterprise +](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")
* You have access to a cloud data platform, permissions to load the sample data tables, and dbt permissions to create new projects.
* This guide uses the Jaffle Shop sample data, including `customers`, `orders`, and `payments` tables. Follow the provided instructions to load this data into your respective data platform:
  + [Snowflake](/guides/snowflake?step=3)
  + [Databricks](/guides/databricks?step=3)
  + [Redshift](/guides/redshift?step=3)
  + [BigQuery](/guides/bigquery?step=3)
  + [Fabric](/guides/microsoft-fabric?step=2)
  + [Starburst Galaxy](/guides/starburst-galaxy?step=2)

This guide assumes you have experience with or fundamental knowledge of dbt. Take the [dbt Fundamentals](https://learn.getdbt.com/courses/dbt-fundamentals) course first if you are brand new to dbt.

Create and configure two projects[​](#create-and-configure-two-projects "Direct link to Create and configure two projects")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, you'll create two new, empty projects in dbt to serve as your foundational and downstream projects:

* **Foundational projects** (or upstream projects) typically contain core models and datasets that serve as the base for further analysis and reporting.
* **Downstream projects** build on these foundations, often adding more specific transformations or business logic for dedicated teams or purposes.

For example, the always-enterprising and fictional account "Jaffle Labs" will create two projects for their data analytics and finance team: Jaffle | Data Analytics and Jaffle | Finance.

[![Create two new dbt projects named 'Jaffle | Data Analytics' and 'Jaffle Finance' ](/img/guides/dbt-mesh/project_names.png?v=2 "Create two new dbt projects named 'Jaffle | Data Analytics' and 'Jaffle Finance' ")](#)Create two new dbt projects named 'Jaffle | Data Analytics' and 'Jaffle Finance'

To [create](/docs/cloud/about-cloud-setup) a new project in dbt:

1. From **Account settings**, go to **Projects**. Click **New project**.
2. Enter a project name and click **Continue**.
   * Use "Jaffle | Data Analytics" for one project
   * Use "Jaffle | Finance" for the other project
3. Select your data platform, then **Next** to set up your connection.
4. In the **Configure your environment** section, enter the **Settings** for your new project.
5. Click **Test Connection**. This verifies that dbt can access your data platform account.
6. Click **Next** if the test succeeded. If it fails, you might need to go back and double-check your settings.
   * For this guide, make sure you create a single [development](/docs/dbt-cloud-environments#create-a-development-environment) and [Deployment](/docs/deploy/deploy-environments) per project.
     + For "Jaffle | Data Analytics", set the default database to `jaffle_da`.
     + For "Jaffle | Finance", set the default database to `jaffle_finance`.
7. Continue the prompts to complete the project setup. Once configured, each project should have:
   * A data platform connection
   * New git repo
   * One or more [environments](/docs/deploy/deploy-environments) (such as development, deployment)

### Create a production environment[​](#create-a-production-environment "Direct link to Create a production environment")

In dbt, each project can have one deployment environment designated as "Production.". You must set up a ["Production" or "Staging" deployment environment](/docs/deploy/deploy-environments) for each project you want to "mesh" together. This enables you to leverage Catalog in the [later steps](/guides/mesh-qs?step=5#create-and-run-a-dbt-cloud-job) of this guide.

To set a production environment:

1. Navigate to **Deploy** -> **Environments**, then click **Create New Environment**.
2. Select **Deployment** as the environment type.
3. Under **Set deployment type**, select the **Production** button.
4. Select the dbt version.
5. Continue filling out the fields as necessary in the **Deployment connection** and **Deployment credentials** sections.
6. Click **Test Connection** to confirm the deployment connection.
7. Click **Save** to create a production environment.

Set up a foundational project[​](#set-up-a-foundational-project "Direct link to Set up a foundational project")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This upstream project is where you build your core data assets. This project will contain the raw data sources, staging models, and core business logic.

dbt enables data practitioners to develop in their tool of choice and comes equipped with a local [dbt CLI](/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation) or in-browser [Studio IDE](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/develop-in-the-cloud).

In this section of the guide, you will set the "Jaffle | Data Analytics" project as your foundational project using the Studio IDE.

1. First, navigate to the **Develop** page to verify your setup.
2. Click **Initialize dbt project** if you’ve started with an empty repo.
3. Delete the `models/example` folder.
4. Navigate to the `dbt_project.yml` file and rename the project (line 5) from `my_new_project` to `analytics`.
5. In your `dbt_project.yml` file, remove lines 39-42 (the `my_new_project` model reference).
6. In the **File Catalog**, hover over the project directory and click the **...**, then select **Create file**.
7. Create two new folders: `models/staging` and `models/core`.

### Staging layer[​](#staging-layer "Direct link to Staging layer")

Now that you've set up the foundational project, let's start building the data assets. Set up the staging layer as follows:

1. Create a new YAML file `models/staging/sources.yml`.
2. Declare the sources by copying the following into the file and clicking **Save**.

models/staging/sources.yml

```
sources:  
  - name: jaffle_shop  
    description: This is a replica of the Postgres database used by our app  
    database: raw  
    schema: jaffle_shop  
    tables:  
      - name: customers  
        description: One record per customer.  
      - name: orders  
        description: One record per order. Includes cancelled and deleted orders.
```

3. Create a `models/staging/stg_customers.sql` file to select from the `customers` table in the `jaffle_shop` source.

models/staging/stg\_customers.sql

```
select  
    id as customer_id,  
    first_name,  
    last_name  
  
from {{ source('jaffle_shop', 'customers') }}
```

4. Create a `models/staging/stg_orders.sql` file to select from the `orders` table in the `jaffle_shop` source.

models/staging/stg\_orders.sql

```
select  
    id as order_id,  
    user_id as customer_id,  
    order_date,  
    status  
  
from {{ source('jaffle_shop', 'orders') }}
```

5. Create a `models/core/fct_orders.sql` file to build a fact table with customer and order details.

models/core/fct\_orders.sql

```
with customers as (  
    select *   
    from {{ ref('stg_customers') }}  
),  
  
orders as (  
    select *   
    from {{ ref('stg_orders') }}  
),  
  
customer_orders as (  
    select  
        customer_id,  
        min(order_date) as first_order_date  
    from orders  
    group by customer_id  
),  
  
final as (  
    select  
        o.order_id,  
        o.order_date,  
        o.status,  
        c.customer_id,  
        c.first_name,  
        c.last_name,  
        co.first_order_date,  
        -- Note that we've used a macro for this so that the appropriate DATEDIFF syntax is used for each respective data platform  
        {{ datediff('first_order_date', 'order_date', 'day') }} as days_as_customer_at_purchase  
    from orders o  
    left join customers c using (customer_id)  
    left join customer_orders co using (customer_id)  
)  
  
select * from final
```

6. Navigate to the **Command bar** and execute `dbt build`.

Before a downstream team can leverage assets from this foundational project, you need to first:

* [Create and define](/docs/mesh/govern/model-access) at least one model as “public”
* Run a [deployment job](/docs/deploy/deploy-jobs) successfully
  + Note, Enable the **Generate docs on run** toggle for this job to update the Catalog. Once run, you can click Explore from the upper menu bar and see your lineage, tests, and documentation coming through successfully.

Define a public model and run first job[​](#define-a-public-model-and-run-first-job "Direct link to Define a public model and run first job")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the previous section, you've arranged your basic building blocks, now let's integrate Mesh.

Although the Finance team requires the `fct_orders` model for analyzing payment trends, other models, particularly those in the staging layer used for data cleansing and joining, are not needed by downstream teams.

To make `fct_orders` publicly available:

1. In the `models/core/core.yml` file, add a `access: public` clause to the relevant YAML file by adding and saving the following:

models/core/core.yml

```
models:  
  - name: fct_orders  
    config:  
      access: public # changed to config in v1.10  
    description: "Customer and order details"  
    columns:  
      - name: order_id  
        data_type: number  
        description: ""  
  
      - name: order_date  
        data_type: date  
        description: ""  
  
      - name: status  
        data_type: varchar  
        description: "Indicates the status of the order"  
  
      - name: customer_id  
        data_type: number  
        description: ""  
  
      - name: first_name  
        data_type: varchar  
        description: ""  
  
      - name: last_name  
        data_type: varchar  
        description: ""  
  
      - name: first_order_date  
        data_type: date  
        description: ""  
  
      - name: days_as_customer_at_purchase  
        data_type: number  
        description: "Days between this purchase and customer's first purchase"
```

Note: By default, model access is set to "protected", which means they can only be referenced within the same project. Learn more about access types and model groups [here](/docs/mesh/govern/model-access#access-modifiers).

2. Navigate to the Studio IDE **Lineage** tab to see the model noted as **Public**, below the model name.

[![Jaffle | Data Analytics lineage](/img/guides/dbt-mesh/da_lineage.png?v=2 "Jaffle | Data Analytics lineage")](#)Jaffle | Data Analytics lineage

3. Go to **Version control** and click the **Commit and Sync** button to commit your changes.
4. Merge your changes to the main or production branch.

### Create and run a dbt job[​](#create-and-run-a-dbt-job "Direct link to Create and run a dbt job")

Before a downstream team can leverage assets from this foundational project, you need to [create a production environment](/guides/mesh-qs?step=3#create-a-production-environment) and run a [deployment job](/docs/deploy/deploy-jobs) successfully.

To run your first deployment dbt job, you will need to create a new dbt job.

1. Go to **Orchestration** > **Jobs**.
2. Click **Create job** and then **Deploy job**.
3. Select the **Generate docs on run** option. This will hydrate your metadata in Catalog.

[![ Select the 'Generate docs on run' option when configuring your dbt job.](/img/guides/dbt-mesh/generate_docs_on_run.png?v=2 " Select the 'Generate docs on run' option when configuring your dbt job.")](#) Select the 'Generate docs on run' option when configuring your dbt job.

4. Click **Save**.
5. Click **Run now** to trigger the job.
6. After the run is complete, navigate to Catalog. You should now see your lineage, tests, and documentation coming through successfully.

For details on how dbt uses metadata from the Staging environment to resolve references in downstream projects, check out the section on [Staging with downstream dependencies](/docs/mesh/govern/project-dependencies#staging-with-downstream-dependencies).

Reference a public model in your downstream project[​](#reference-a-public-model-in-your-downstream-project "Direct link to Reference a public model in your downstream project")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, you will set up the downstream project, "Jaffle | Finance", and [cross-project reference](/docs/mesh/govern/project-dependencies) the `fct_orders` model from the foundational project. Navigate to the **Develop** page to set up our project:

1. If you’ve also started with a new git repo, click **Initialize dbt project** under the **Version control** section.
2. Delete the `models/example` folder.
3. Navigate to the `dbt_project.yml` file and rename the project (line 5) from `my_new_project` to `finance`.
4. Navigate to the `dbt_project.yml` file and remove lines 39-42 (the `my_new_project` model reference).
5. In the **File Catalog**, hover over the project directory, click the **...** and select **Create file**.
6. Name the file `dependencies.yml`.
7. Add the upstream `analytics` project and the `dbt_utils` package. Click **Save**.

dependencies.yml

```
packages:  
  - package: dbt-labs/dbt_utils  
    version: 1.1.1  
  
projects:  
  - name: analytics
```

### Staging layer[​](#staging-layer-1 "Direct link to Staging layer")

Now that you've set up the foundational project, let's start building the data assets. Set up the staging layer as follows:

1. Create a new YAML file `models/staging/sources.yml` and declare the sources by copying the following into the file and clicking **Save**.

   models/staging/sources.yml

   ```
   sources:  
     - name: stripe  
       database: raw  
       schema: stripe   
       tables:  
         - name: payment
   ```
2. Create `models/staging/stg_payments.sql` to select from the `payment` table in the `stripe` source.

   models/staging/stg\_payments.sql

   ```
   with payments as (  
       select * from {{ source('stripe', 'payment') }}  
   ),  
     
   final as (  
       select   
           id as payment_id,  
           orderID as order_id,  
           paymentMethod as payment_method,  
           amount,  
           created as payment_date   
       from payments  
   )  
     
   select * from final
   ```

### Reference the public model[​](#reference-the-public-model "Direct link to Reference the public model")

You're now set to add a model that explores how payment types vary throughout a customer's journey. This helps determine whether coupon gift cards decrease with repeat purchases, as our marketing team anticipates, or remain consistent.

1. To reference the model, use the following logic to ascertain this:

   models/core/agg\_customer\_payment\_journey.sql

   ```
   with stg_payments as (  
       select * from {{ ref('stg_payments') }}  
   ),  
     
   fct_orders as (  
       select * from {{ ref('analytics', 'fct_orders') }}  
   ),  
     
   final as (  
       select   
           days_as_customer_at_purchase,  
           -- we use the pivot macro in the dbt_utils package to create columns that total payments for each method  
           {{ dbt_utils.pivot(  
               'payment_method',  
               dbt_utils.get_column_values(ref('stg_payments'), 'payment_method'),  
               agg='sum',  
               then_value='amount',  
               prefix='total_',  
               suffix='_amount'  
           ) }},   
           sum(amount) as total_amount  
       from fct_orders  
       left join stg_payments using (order_id)  
       group by 1  
   )  
     
   select * from final
   ```
2. Notice the cross-project ref at work! When you add the `ref`, the Studio IDE's auto-complete feature recognizes the public model as available.

[![Cross-project ref autocomplete in the Studio IDE](/img/guides/dbt-mesh/cross_proj_ref_autocomplete.png?v=2 "Cross-project ref autocomplete in the Studio IDE")](#)Cross-project ref autocomplete in the Studio IDE

3. This automatically resolves (or links) to the correct database, schema, and table/view set by the upstream project.

[![Cross-project ref compile](/img/guides/dbt-mesh/cross_proj_ref_compile.png?v=2 "Cross-project ref compile")](#)Cross-project ref compile

4. You can also see this connection displayed in the live **Lineage** tab.

Add model versions and contracts[​](#add-model-versions-and-contracts "Direct link to Add model versions and contracts")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How can you enhance resilience and add guardrails to this type of multi-project relationship? You can adopt best practices from software engineering by:

1. Defining model contracts — Set up [model contracts](/docs/mesh/govern/model-contracts) in dbt to define a set of upfront "guarantees" that define the shape of your model. While building your model, dbt will verify that your model's transformation will produce a dataset matching up with its contract; if not, the build fails.
2. Defining model versions — Use [model versions](/docs/mesh/govern/model-versions) to manage updates and handle breaking changes systematically.

### Set up model contracts[​](#set-up-model-contracts "Direct link to Set up model contracts")

As part of the Data Analytics team, you may want to ensure the `fct_orders` model is reliable for downstream users, like the Finance team.

1. Navigate to `models/core/core.yml` and under the `fct_orders` model before the `columns:` section, add a data contract to enforce reliability:

```
models:  
  - name: fct_orders  
    description: “Customer and order details”  
    config:  
      access: public # changed to config in v1.10  
      contract:  
        enforced: true  
    columns:  
      - name: order_id  
        .....
```

2. Test what would happen if this contract were violated. In `models/core/fct_orders.sql`, comment out the `orders.status` column and click **Build** to try building the model.
   * If the contract is breached, the build fails, as seen in the command bar history.

   [![The data contract was breached and the dbt build run failed.](/img/guides/dbt-mesh/break_contract.png?v=2 "The data contract was breached and the dbt build run failed.")](#)The data contract was breached and the dbt build run failed.

### Set up model versions[​](#set-up-model-versions "Direct link to Set up model versions")

In this section, you will set up model versions by the Data Analytics team as they upgrade the `fct_orders` model while offering backward compatibility and a migration notice to the downstream Finance team.

1. Rename the existing model file from `models/core/fct_orders.sql` to `models/core/fct_orders_v1.sql`.
2. Create a new file `models/core/fct_orders_v2.sql` and adjust the schema:

   * Comment out `o.status` in the `final` CTE.
   * Add a new field, `case when o.status = 'returned' then true else false end as is_return` to indicate if an order was returned.
3. Then, add the following to your `models/core/core.yml` file:

   * The `is_return` column
   * The two model `versions`
   * A `latest_version` to indicate which model is the latest (and should be used by default, unless specified otherwise)
   * A `deprecation_date` to version 1 as well to indicate when the model will be deprecated.
4. It should now read as follows:

models/core/core.yml

```
models:  
  - name: fct_orders  
    description: "Customer and order details"  
    latest_version: 2  
    config:  
      access: public # changed to config in v1.10  
      contract:  
        enforced: true  
    columns:  
      - name: order_id  
        data_type: number  
        description: ""  
  
      - name: order_date  
        data_type: date  
        description: ""  
  
      - name: status  
        data_type: varchar  
        description: "Indicates the status of the order"  
  
      - name: is_return  
        data_type: boolean  
        description: "Indicates if an order was returned"  
  
      - name: customer_id  
        data_type: number  
        description: ""

5. Verify how dbt compiles the `ref` statement based on the updates. Open a new file, add the following select statements, and click **Compile**. Note how each ref is compiled to the specified version (or the latest version if not specified).

```
select * from {{ ref('fct_orders', v=1) }}  
select * from {{ ref('fct_orders', v=2) }}  
select * from {{ ref('fct_orders') }}
```

Add a dbt job in the downstream project[​](#add-a-dbt-job-in-the-downstream-project "Direct link to Add a dbt job in the downstream project")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before proceeding, make sure you commit and merge your changes in both the “Jaffle | Data Analytics” and “Jaffle | Finance” projects.

A member of the Finance team would like to schedule a dbt job for their customer payment journey analysis immediately after the data analytics team refreshes their pipelines.

1. In the “Jaffle | Finance” project, go to the **Jobs** page by navigating to **Orchestration** > **Jobs**.
2. Click **Create job** and then **Deploy job**.
3. Add a name for the job, then scroll to the bottom of the **Job completion** section.
4. In the **Triggers** section, configure the job to **Run when another job finishes** and select the upstream job from the “Jaffle | Data Analytics” project.

[![Trigger job on completion](/img/guides/dbt-mesh/trigger_on_completion.png?v=2 "Trigger job on completion")](#)Trigger job on completion

5. Click **Save** and verify the job is set up correctly.
6. Go to the “Jaffle | Data Analytics” jobs page. Select the **Daily job** and click **Run now**.
7. Once this job completes successfully, go back to the “Jaffle | Finance” jobs page. You should see that the Finance team’s job was triggered automatically.

This simplifies the process of staying in sync with the upstream tables and removes the need for more sophisticated orchestration skills, such as coordinating jobs across projects via an external orchestrator.

View deprecation warning[​](#view-deprecation-warning "Direct link to View deprecation warning")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To find out how long the Finance team has to migrate from `fct_orders_v1` to `fct_orders_v2`, follow these steps:

1. In the “Jaffle | Finance” project, navigate to the **Develop** page.
2. Edit the cross-project ref to use v=1 in `models/marts/agg_customer_payment_journey.sql`:

models/core/agg\_customer\_payment\_journey.sql

```
with stg_payments as (  
    select * from {{ ref('stg_payments') }}  
),  
  
fct_orders as (  
    select * from {{ ref('analytics', 'fct_orders', v=1) }}  
),  
  
final as (  
    select   
        days_as_customer_at_purchase,  
        -- we use the pivot macro in the dbt_utils package to create columns that total payments for each method  
        {{ dbt_utils.pivot(  
            'payment_method',  
            dbt_utils.get_column_values(ref('stg_payments'), 'payment_method'),  
            agg='sum',  
            then_value='amount',  
            prefix='total_',  
            suffix='_amount'  
        ) }},   
        sum(amount) as total_amount  
    from fct_orders  
    left join stg_payments using (order_id)  
    group by 1  
)  
  
select * from final
```

3. In the Studio IDE, go to **Version control** to commit and merge the changes.
4. Go to the **Deploy** and then **Jobs** page.
5. Click **Run now** to run the Finance job. The `agg_customer_payment_journey` model will build and display a deprecation date warning.
