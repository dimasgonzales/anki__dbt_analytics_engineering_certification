Docs for [dbt-labs/dbt-core#8772](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/pull/8772)

You can now generate docs for a subset of your dbt project, by using the `--select` flag with `dbt docs generate`. Selectors will limit the information returned in the `catalog.json` to only the selected nodes.

`dbt docs generate --select ...`

At least one page to update:

* <https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/cmd-docs#dbt-docs-generate>

Examples
--------

### Select a single node

Just one node named `orders`:

```
dbt docs generate --select orders
```

### Select zero nodes

As already documented [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/cmd-docs#dbt-docs-generate), generate an empty catalog:

```
dbt docs generate --empty-catalog
```

### Skip compilation

Node selection that affects `catalog.json` (via `--select`) can be used in conjunction with `--no-compile` that affects `manifest.json`.

As already documented [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/cmd-docs#dbt-docs-generate), skip compiling the resources in your project, so that their `compiled_code` will be **not** included in [`manifest.json`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/artifacts/manifest-json):

```
dbt docs generate --no-compile --select orders
```
