Definition[​](#definition "Direct link to Definition")
------------------------------------------------------

A freshness block is used to define the acceptable amount of time between the most recent record, and now, for a table to be considered "fresh".

In the `freshness` block, one or both of `warn_after` and `error_after` can be provided. If neither is provided, then dbt will not calculate freshness snapshots for the tables in this source.

In most cases, the `loaded_at_field` is required. Some adapters support calculating source freshness from the warehouse metadata tables and can exclude the `loaded_at_field`.

If a source has a `freshness:` block, dbt will attempt to calculate freshness for that source:

* If `loaded_at_field` is provided, dbt will calculate freshness via a select query.
* If `loaded_at_field` is *not* provided, dbt will calculate freshness via warehouse metadata tables when possible.

Currently, calculating freshness from warehouse metadata tables is supported on the following adapters:

* [Snowflake](/reference/resource-configs/snowflake-configs)
* [Redshift](/reference/resource-configs/redshift-configs)
* [BigQuery](/reference/resource-configs/bigquery-configs) (Supported in [`dbt-bigquery`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-bigquery) version 1.7.3 or higher)
* [Databricks](/reference/resource-configs/databricks-configs) (Supported in the dbt Fusion Engine)

Freshness blocks are applied hierarchically:

* A `freshness` and `loaded_at_field` property added to a source will be applied to all tables defined in that source.
* A `freshness` and `loaded_at_field` property added to a source *table* will override any properties applied to the source.

This is useful when all of the tables in a source have the same `loaded_at_field`, as is often the case.

To exclude a source from freshness calculations, explicitly set `freshness: null`.

In state-aware orchestration, dbt uses the warehouse metadata by default to check if sources (or upstream models in the case of Mesh) are fresh. For more information on how freshness is used by state-aware orchestration, see [Advanced configurations](/docs/deploy/state-aware-setup#advanced-configurations).

loaded\_at\_field[​](#loaded_at_field "Direct link to loaded_at_field")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Optional on adapters that support pulling freshness from warehouse metadata tables, required otherwise.
  
  
A column name (or expression) that returns a timestamp indicating freshness.

If using a date field, you may have to cast it to a timestamp:

```
loaded_at_field: "completed_date::timestamp"
```

Or, depending on your SQL variant:

```
loaded_at_field: "CAST(completed_date AS TIMESTAMP)"
```

If using a non-UTC timestamp, cast it to UTC first:

```
loaded_at_field: "convert_timezone('Australia/Sydney', 'UTC', created_at_local)"
```

count[​](#count "Direct link to count")
---------------------------------------

(Required)

A positive integer for the number of periods where a data source is still considered "fresh".

period[​](#period "Direct link to period")
------------------------------------------

(Required)

The time period used in the freshness calculation. One of `minute`, `hour` or `day`

filter[​](#filter "Direct link to filter")
------------------------------------------

(optional)

Add a where clause to the query run by `dbt source freshness` in order to limit data scanned.

This filter *only* applies to dbt's source freshness queries - it will not impact other uses of the source table.

This is particularly useful if:

* You are using BigQuery and your source tables are [partitioned tables](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables)
* You are using Snowflake, Databricks, or Spark with large tables, and this results in a performance benefit

models/<filename>.yml

```
sources:  
  - name: jaffle_shop  
    database: raw  
    config:   
      # changed to config in v1.9  
      freshness: # default freshness  
        warn_after: {count: 12, period: hour}  
        error_after: {count: 24, period: hour}  
  
      loaded_at_field: _etl_loaded_at  
  
    tables:  
      - name: customers # this will use the freshness defined above  
  
      - name: orders  
        config:  
          freshness: # make this a little more strict  
            warn_after: {count: 6, period: hour}  
            error_after: {count: 12, period: hour}  
            # Apply a where clause in the freshness query  
            filter: datediff('day', _etl_loaded_at, current_timestamp) < 2  
  
  
      - name: product_skus  
        config:  
          freshness: # do not check freshness for this table
```

When running `dbt source freshness`, the following query will be run:

* Compiled SQL
* Jinja SQL

```
select  
  max(_etl_loaded_at) as max_loaded_at,  
  convert_timezone('UTC', current_timestamp()) as snapshotted_at  
from raw.jaffle_shop.orders  
  
where datediff('day', _etl_loaded_at, current_timestamp) < 2
```

```
select  
  max({{ loaded_at_field }}) as max_loaded_at,  
  {{ current_timestamp() }} as snapshotted_at  
from {{ source }}  
{% if filter %}  
where {{ filter }}  
{% endif %}
```
