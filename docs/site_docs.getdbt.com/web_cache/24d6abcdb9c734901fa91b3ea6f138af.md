# Previously, attempting to access a configuration value like this would result in None
print(f"{dbt.config.get('my_var')}")  # Output before change: None

# Now you can access the actual configuration value
# Assuming 'my_var' is configured to 5 for the current model
print(f"{dbt.config.get('my_var')}")  # Output after change: 5
```

This also means you can use `dbt.config.get()` within Python models to ensure that configuration values are effectively retrievable and usable within Python f-strings.

Configuring Python models
-------------------------

Just like SQL models, there are three ways to configure Python models:

1. In `dbt_project.yml`, where you can configure many models at once
2. In a dedicated `.yml` file, within the `models/` directory
3. Within the model's `.py` file, using the `dbt.config()` method

Calling the `dbt.config()` method will set configurations for your model within your `.py` file, similar to the `{{ config() }}` macro in `.sql` model files:

```
def model(dbt, session):

    # setting configuration
    dbt.config(materialized="table")
```

There's a limit to how complex you can get with the `dbt.config()` method. It accepts *only* literal values (strings, booleans, and numeric types) and dynamic configuration. Passing another function or a more complex data structure is not possible. The reason is that dbt statically analyzes the arguments to `config()` while parsing your model without executing your Python code. If you need to set a more complex configuration, we recommend you define it using the [`config` property](/dbt-labs/docs.getdbt.com/blob/current/reference/resource-properties/config) in a YAML file.

#### Accessing project context

dbt Python models don't use Jinja to render compiled code. Python models have limited access to global project contexts compared to SQL models. That context is made available from the `dbt` class, passed in as an argument to the `model()` function.

Out of the box, the `dbt` class supports:

* Returning DataFrames referencing the locations of other resources: `dbt.ref()` + `dbt.source()`
* Accessing the database location of the current model: `dbt.this()` (also: `dbt.this.database`, `.schema`, `.identifier`)
* Determining if the current model's run is incremental: `dbt.is_incremental`

It is possible to extend this context by "getting" them with `dbt.config.get()` after they are configured in the [model's config](/dbt-labs/docs.getdbt.com/blob/current/reference/model-configs). The `dbt.config.get()` method supports dynamic access to configurations within Python models, enhancing flexibility in model logic. This includes inputs such as `var`, `env_var`, and `target`. If you want to use those values for the conditional logic in your model, we require setting them through a dedicated YAML file config:

```
models:
  - name: my_python_model
    config:
      materialized: table
      target_name: "{{ target.name }}"
      specific_var: "{{ var('SPECIFIC_VAR') }}"
      specific_env_var: "{{ env_var('SPECIFIC_ENV_VAR') }}"
```

Then, within the model's Python code, use the `dbt.config.get()` function to *access* values of configurations that have been set:

```
def model(dbt, session):
    target_name = dbt.config.get("target_name")
    specific_var = dbt.config.get("specific_var")
    specific_env_var = dbt.config.get("specific_env_var")

    orders_df = dbt.ref("fct_orders")

    # limit data in dev
    if target_name == "dev":
        orders_df = orders_df.limit(500)
```

#### Dynamic configurations

In addition to the existing methods of configuring Python models, you also have dynamic access to configuration values set with `dbt.config()` within Python models using f-strings. This increases the possibilities for custom logic and configuration management.

```
def model(dbt, session):
    dbt.config(materialized="table")
    
    # Dynamic configuration access within Python f-strings, 
    # which allows for real-time retrieval and use of configuration values.
    # Assuming 'my_var' is set to 5, this will print: Dynamic config value: 5
    print(f"Dynamic config value: {dbt.config.get('my_var')}")
```

### Materializations

Python models support these materializations:

* `table` (default)
* `incremental`

Incremental Python models support all the same [incremental strategies](/dbt-labs/docs.getdbt.com/blob/current/docs/build/incremental-strategy) as their SQL counterparts. The specific strategies supported depend on your adapter. As an example, incremental models are supported on BigQuery with Dataproc for the `merge` incremental strategy; the `insert_overwrite` strategy is not yet supported.

Python models can't be materialized as `view` or `ephemeral`. Python isn't supported for non-model resource types (like tests and snapshots).

For incremental models, like SQL models, you need to filter incoming tables to only new rows of data:

```
import snowflake.snowpark.functions as F

def model(dbt, session):
    dbt.config(materialized = "incremental")
    df = dbt.ref("upstream_table")

    if dbt.is_incremental:

        # only new rows compared to max in current table
        max_from_this = f"select max(updated_at) from {dbt.this}"
        df = df.filter(df.updated_at >= session.sql(max_from_this).collect()[0][0])

        # or only rows from the past 3 days
        df = df.filter(df.updated_at >= F.dateadd("day", F.lit(-3), F.current_timestamp()))

    ...

    return df
```

```
import datetime

def model(dbt, session):
  dbt.config(materialized = "incremental")
  bdf = dbt.ref("upstream_table")

  if dbt.is_incremental:

    # only new rows compared to max in current table
    max_from_this = f"select max(updated_at) from {dbt.this}"

    bdf = bdf[bdf['updated_at'] >= bpd.read_gbq(max_from_this).values[0][0]]
    # or only rows from the past 3 days
    bdf = bdf[bdf['updated_at'] >= datetime.date.today() - datetime.timedelta(days=3)]

    ...

  return bdf
```

```
import pyspark.sql.functions as F

def model(dbt, session):
    dbt.config(materialized = "incremental")
    df = dbt.ref("upstream_table")

    if dbt.is_incremental:

        # only new rows compared to max in current table
        max_from_this = f"select max(updated_at) from {dbt.this}"
        df = df.filter(df.updated_at >= session.sql(max_from_this).collect()[0][0])

        # or only rows from the past 3 days
        df = df.filter(df.updated_at >= F.date_add(F.current_timestamp(), F.lit(-3)))

    ...

    return df
```

Python-specific functionality
-----------------------------

### Defining functions

In addition to defining a `model` function, the Python model can import other functions or define its own. Here's an example on Snowpark, defining a custom `add_one` function:

```
def add_one(x):
    return x + 1

def model(dbt, session):
    dbt.config(materialized="table")
    temps_df = dbt.ref("temperatures")

    # warm things up just a little
    df = temps_df.withColumn("degree_plus_one", add_one(temps_df["degree"]))
    return df
```

Currently, Python functions defined in one dbt model can't be imported and reused in other models. Refer to [Code reuse](#code-reuse) for the potential patterns being considered.

### Using PyPI packages

You can also define functions that depend on third-party packages so long as those packages are installed and available to the Python runtime on your data platform.

In this example, we use the `holidays` package to determine if a given date is a holiday in France. The code below uses the pandas API for simplicity and consistency across platforms. The exact syntax, and the need to refactor for multi-node processing, still vary.

```
import holidays

def is_holiday(date_col):
    # Chez Jaffle
    french_holidays = holidays.France()
    is_holiday = (date_col in french_holidays)
    return is_holiday

def model(dbt, session):
    dbt.config(
        materialized = "table",
        packages = ["holidays"]
    )

    orders_df = dbt.ref("stg_orders")

    df = orders_df.to_pandas()

    # apply our function
    # (columns need to be in uppercase on Snowpark)
    df["IS_HOLIDAY"] = df["ORDER_DATE"].apply(is_holiday)
    df["ORDER_DATE"].dt.tz_localize('UTC') # convert from Number/Long to tz-aware Datetime

    # return final dataset (Pandas DataFrame)
    return df
```

```
import holidays

def model(dbt, session):
    dbt.config(submission_method="bigframes")

    data = {
    'id': [0, 1, 2],
    'name': ['Brian Davis', 'Isaac Smith', 'Marie White'],
    'birthday': ['2024-03-14', '2024-01-01', '2024-11-07']
    }
    bdf = bpd.DataFrame(data)
    bdf['birthday'] = bpd.to_datetime(bdf['birthday'])
    bdf['birthday'] = bdf['birthday'].dt.date

    us_holidays = holidays.US(years=2024)

    return bdf[bdf['birthday'].isin(us_holidays)]
```

```
import holidays

def is_holiday(date_col):
    # Chez Jaffle
    french_holidays = holidays.France()
    is_holiday = (date_col in french_holidays)
    return is_holiday

def model(dbt, session):
    dbt.config(
        materialized = "table",
        packages = ["holidays"]
    )

    orders_df = dbt.ref("stg_orders")

    df = orders_df.to_pandas_on_spark()  # Spark 3.2+
    # df = orders_df.toPandas() in earlier versions

    # apply our function
    df["is_holiday"] = df["order_date"].apply(is_holiday)

    # convert back to PySpark
    df = df.to_spark()               # Spark 3.2+
    # df = session.createDataFrame(df) in earlier versions

    # return final dataset (PySpark DataFrame)
    return df
```

#### Configuring packages

We encourage you to configure required packages and versions so dbt can track them in project metadata. This configuration is required for the implementation on some platforms. If you need specific versions of packages, specify them.

```
def model(dbt, session):
    dbt.config(
        packages = ["numpy==1.23.1", "scikit-learn"]
    )
```

```
models:
  - name: my_python_model
    config:
      packages:
        - "numpy==1.23.1"
        - scikit-learn
```

#### User-defined functions (UDFs)

You can use the `@udf` decorator or `udf` function to define an "anonymous" function and call it within your `model` function's DataFrame transformation. This is a typical pattern for applying more complex functions as DataFrame operations, especially if those functions require inputs from third-party packages.

* [Snowpark Python: Creating UDFs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/python/creating-udfs.html)
* [BigQuery DataFrames UDFs](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/use-bigquery-dataframes#custom-python-functions)
* [PySpark functions: udf](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.functions.udf.html)

:::tip
You can also define [SQL or Python UDFs](/dbt-labs/docs.getdbt.com/blob/current/docs/build/udfs) as first-class resources under `/functions` with a matching `YAML` file. dbt builds them as part of the DAG, and you reference them from SQL using `{{ function('my_udf') }}`. These UDFs are reusable across tools (BI, notebooks, SQL clients) because they live in your warehouse.
:::

```
import snowflake.snowpark.types as T
import snowflake.snowpark.functions as F
import numpy

def register_udf_add_random():
    add_random = F.udf(
        # use 'lambda' syntax, for simple functional behavior
        lambda x: x + numpy.random.normal(),
        return_type=T.FloatType(),
        input_types=[T.FloatType()]
    )
    return add_random

def model(dbt, session):

    dbt.config(
        materialized = "table",
        packages = ["numpy"]
    )

    temps_df = dbt.ref("temperatures")

    add_random = register_udf_add_random()

    # warm things up, who knows by how much
    df = temps_df.withColumn("degree_plus_random", add_random("degree"))
    return df
```

**Note:** Due to a Snowpark limitation, it is not currently possible to register complex named UDFs within stored procedures and, therefore, dbt Python models. We are looking to add native support for Python UDFs as a project/DAG resource type in a future release. For the time being, if you want to create a "vectorized" Python UDF via the Batch API, we recommend either:

* Writing [`create function`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/udf/python/udf-python-batch.html) inside a SQL macro, to run as a hook or run-operation
* [Registering from a staged file](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/python/creating-udfs#creating-a-udf-from-a-python-source-file) within your Python model code

```
def model(dbt, session):
    dbt.config(submission_method="bigframes")

    # You can also use @bpd.udf
    @bpd.remote_function(dataset='jialuo_test_us')
    def my_func(x: int) -> int:
        return x * 1100

    data = {"int": [1, 2], "str": ['a', 'b']}
    bdf = bpd.DataFrame(data=data)
    bdf['int'] = bdf['int'].apply(my_func)

    return bdf
```

```
import pyspark.sql.types as T
import pyspark.sql.functions as F
import numpy

# use a 'decorator' for more readable code
@F.udf(returnType=T.DoubleType())
def add_random(x):
    random_number = numpy.random.normal()
    return x + random_number

def model(dbt, session):
    dbt.config(
        materialized = "table",
        packages = ["numpy"]
    )

    temps_df = dbt.ref("temperatures")

    # warm things up, who knows by how much
    df = temps_df.withColumn("degree_plus_random", add_random("degree"))
    return df
```

#### Code reuse

To re-use a Python function across multiple dbt models, you can define [Python UDFs](/dbt-labs/docs.getdbt.com/blob/current/docs/build/udfs) under `/functions` with a matching YAML file. These UDFs live in your warehouse and can be reused across tools (BI, notebooks, SQL clients).

In the future, we're considering also adding support for Private Python packages. In addition to importing reusable functions from public PyPI packages, many data platforms support uploading custom Python assets and registering them as packages. The upload process looks different across platforms, but your code’s actual `import` looks the same.

:::note ❓ dbt questions

* How can dbt help users when uploading or initializing private Python assets? Is this a new form of `dbt deps`?
* How can dbt support users who want to test custom functions? If defined as UDFs: "unit testing" in the database? If "pure" functions in packages: encourage adoption of `pytest`?

### DataFrame API and syntax

Over the past decade, most people writing [data transformations](https://www.getdbt.com/analytics-engineering/transformation/) in Python have adopted DataFrame as their common abstraction. dbt follows this convention by returning `ref()` and `source()` as DataFrames, and it expects all Python models to return a DataFrame.

A DataFrame is a two-dimensional data structure (rows and columns). It supports convenient methods for transforming that data and creating new columns from calculations performed on existing columns. It also offers convenient ways for previewing data while developing locally or in a notebook.

That's about where the agreement ends. There are numerous frameworks with their own syntaxes and APIs for DataFrames. The [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) library offered one of the original DataFrame APIs, and its syntax is the most common to learn for new data professionals. Most newer DataFrame APIs are compatible with pandas-style syntax, though few can offer perfect interoperability. This is true for BigQuery DataFrames, Snowpark, and PySpark, which have their own DataFrame APIs.

When developing a Python model, you will find yourself asking these questions:

**Why pandas?** — It's the most common API for DataFrames. It makes it easy to explore sampled data and develop transformations locally. You can “promote” your code as-is into dbt models and run it in production for small datasets.

**Why *not* pandas?** — Performance. pandas runs "single-node" transformations, which cannot benefit from the parallelism and distributed computing offered by modern data warehouses. This quickly becomes a problem as you operate on larger datasets. Some data platforms support optimizations for code written using pandas DataFrame API, preventing the need for major refactors. For example, [pandas on PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/getting_started/quickstart_ps.html) offers support for 95% of pandas functionality, using the same API while still leveraging parallel processing.

:::note ❓ dbt questions

* When developing a new dbt Python model, should we recommend pandas-style syntax for rapid iteration and then refactor?
* Which open source libraries provide compelling abstractions across different data engines and vendor-specific APIs?
* Should dbt attempt to play a longer-term role in standardizing across them?

Limitations
-----------

Python models have capabilities that SQL models do not. They also have some drawbacks compared to SQL models:

* **Time and cost.** Python models are slower to run than SQL models, and the cloud resources that run them can be more expensive. Running Python requires more general-purpose compute. That compute might sometimes live on a separate service or architecture from your SQL models. **However:** We believe that deploying Python models via dbt—with unified lineage, testing, and documentation—is, from a human standpoint, **dramatically** faster and cheaper. By comparison, spinning up separate infrastructure to orchestrate Python transformations in production and different tooling to integrate with dbt is much more time-consuming and expensive.
* **Syntax differences** are even more pronounced. Over the years, dbt has done a lot, via dispatch patterns and packages such as `dbt_utils`, to abstract over differences in SQL dialects across popular data warehouses. Python offers a **much** wider field of play. If there are five ways to do something in SQL, there are 500 ways to write it in Python, all with varying performance and adherence to standards. Those options can be overwhelming. As the maintainers of dbt, we will be learning from state-of-the-art projects tackling this problem and sharing guidance as we develop it.
* **These capabilities are very new.** As data warehouses develop new features, we expect them to offer cheaper, faster, and more intuitive mechanisms for deploying Python transformations. **We reserve the right to change the underlying implementation for executing Python models in future releases.** Our commitment to you is around the code in your model `.py` files, following the documented capabilities and guidance we're providing here.
* **Lack of `print()` support.** The data platform runs and compiles your Python model without dbt's oversight. This means it doesn't display the output of commands such as Python's built-in [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) function in dbt's logs.
* The following explains other methods you can use for debugging, such as writing messages to a dataframe column:

  + Using platform logs: Use your data platform's logs to debug your Python models.
  + Return logs as a dataframe: Create a dataframe containing your logs and build it into the warehouse.
  + Develop locally with DuckDB: Test and debug your models locally using DuckDB before deploying them.

  Here's an example of debugging in a Python model:

  ```
  def model(dbt, session):
      dbt.config(
          materialized = "table"
      )

      df = dbt.ref("my_source_table").df()

      # One option for debugging: write messages to temporary table column
      # Pros: visibility
      # Cons: won't work if table isn't building for some reason
      msg = "something"
      df["debugging"] = f"My debug message here: {msg}"

      return df
  ```

As a general rule, if there's a transformation you could write equally well in SQL or Python, we believe that well-written SQL is preferable: it's more accessible to a greater number of colleagues, and it's easier to write code that's performant at scale. If there's a transformation you *can't* write in SQL, or where ten lines of elegant and well-annotated Python could save you 1000 lines of hard-to-read Jinja-SQL, Python is the way to go.
