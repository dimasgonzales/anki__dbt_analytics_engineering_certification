# You can also set the DBT_STATE environment variable instead of the --state flag.  
dbt run --select "result:<status>" --defer --state path/to/prod/artifacts
```

The available options depend on the resource (node) type:

| `result:\<status>` | model | seed | snapshot | test |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `result:error` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `result:success` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |  |
| `result:skipped` | ✅ |  | ✅ | ✅ |
| `result:fail` |  |  |  | ✅ |
| `result:warn` |  |  |  | ✅ |
| `result:pass` |  |  |  | ✅ |

### Combining `state` and `result` selectors[​](#combining-state-and-result-selectors "Direct link to combining-state-and-result-selectors")

The state and result selectors can also be combined in a single invocation of dbt to capture errors from a previous run OR any new or modified models.

```
dbt run --select "result:<status>+" state:modified+ --defer --state ./<dbt-artifact-path>
```

### The "source\_status" status[​](#the-source_status-status "Direct link to The \"source_status\" status")

Another element of job state is the `source_status` of a prior dbt invocation. After executing `dbt source freshness`, for example, dbt creates the `sources.json` artifact which contains execution times and `max_loaded_at` dates for dbt sources. You can read more about `sources.json` on the ['sources'](/reference/artifacts/sources-json) page.

The `dbt source freshness` command produces a `sources.json` artifact whose results can be referenced in subsequent dbt invocations.

When a job is selected, dbt will surface the artifacts from that job's most recent successful run. dbt will then use those artifacts to determine the set of fresh sources. In your job commands, you can signal dbt to run and test only on the fresher sources and their children by including the `source_status:fresher+` argument. This requires both the previous and current states to have the `sources.json` artifact available. Or plainly said, both job states need to run `dbt source freshness`.

After issuing the `dbt source freshness` command, you can reference the source freshness results by adding a selector to a subsequent command:

```
# You can also set the DBT_STATE environment variable instead of the --state flag.  
dbt source freshness # must be run again to compare current to previous state  
dbt build --select "source_status:fresher+" --state path/to/prod/artifacts
```
