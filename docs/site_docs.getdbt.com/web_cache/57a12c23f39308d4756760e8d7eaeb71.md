### Contributions

* I have read the contribution docs, and understand what's expected of me.

### TLDR

* **Models:** It is possible to configure quoting for `database`, `schema`, and `identifier` names on a dbt project-wide basis via [`quoting`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/project-configs/quoting), but **not** a per-model (or per-seed) basis. However, `column` names can be configured on a per-model basis via [`quote`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/quote), but not project-wide.
* **Sources:** `database`, `schema`, and `identifier`, and `column` names can be configured on a per-source and per-table basis (via [`quoting`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/quoting) and [`quote`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/quote)), but not project-wide.

There are many related pieces in the product documentation, but they aren't linked together (which is the aim of this documentation proposal).

The feature proposal in [dbt-labs/dbt-core#2986](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/2986) aims to unify these 4 levels of quoting into a `quote` config that can be applied [hierarchically](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/configs-and-properties#config-inheritance) from project-wide down to the individual resource-level.

### Link to the page on docs.getdbt.com requiring updates

There are a couple things that are mostly frequently quoted within SQL:

1. database identifier *names*
2. column *names* and *values*

For example, all of the following can be quoted within SQL:

* `database` / catalog names (`project` in BigQuery)
* `schema` names (`dataset` in BigQuery)
* `identifier` names (table / view / etc. names)
* `column` *names*
* `column` *values*
* other database object names (`user`s, `role`s, `index`es, etc.)

We have all of the following documentation, but it rarely refers to each other:

#### For `database`, `schema`, and `identifier` names

* [`quoting`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/project-configs/quoting) - Configuring quoting in **projects** (for `database`, `schema`, and `identifier`)
* [`quoting`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/quoting) - Configuring quoting in **sources** (for `database`, `schema`, and `identifier`)
* [`quoted`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/blob/154ca610f67906b0affea9a1e85d29126721cafd/dbt/adapters/base/relation.py#L217) method in the Relation class - Applying quoting to **relations** (for `database`, `schema`, and `identifier`) ([source](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/blob/d831caa33bc1a31d1162f1d1b3ccd6caaec08fd5/dbt/adapters/base/column.py#L37))
* [`as_case_sensitive`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-snowflake/pull/1107) in the SnowflakeRelation class (see also: [dbt-snowflake dbt-labs/dbt-adapters#714](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/issues/714))

#### For `column` names

* [`quote`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/quote) - Configuring quoting in **models** for `column` names
  + also **sources**, **seeds**, **snapshots**, and **analyses** if you click the tabs
* [`quote_columns`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/quote_columns) - Configuring quoting in **seed** files for `column` names
  + [`quote_seed_column`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/blob/d831caa33bc1a31d1162f1d1b3ccd6caaec08fd5/dbt/adapters/base/impl.py#L928) - Quote or do not quote the column name of a seed according to the [`quote_columns`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/quote_columns) configuration
* [`quoted`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/blob/154ca610f67906b0affea9a1e85d29126721cafd/dbt/adapters/base/column.py#L37) method in the Column class via [Column API](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-classes#column-api) - Applying quoting to relation **columns** for `column` names
* [`quote_identifiers`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils) in macros within `dbt_utils` (like [`star`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils?tab=readme-ov-file#star-source) and [`pivot`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils?tab=readme-ov-file#pivot-source))

#### For `column` values

* [`quote` within `accepted_values`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/data-tests#accepted_values) - Configuring quoting in **data tests** for accepted `column` values
* [`dbt.string_literal`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/blob/c310bc5fbd36e510353cfcd9a451f69bfdb9c9c3/dbt/include/global_project/macros/utils/literal.sql#L5-L7) - Applying quoting to `column` values in Jinja
* [`dbt.escape_single_quotes`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/blob/c310bc5fbd36e510353cfcd9a451f69bfdb9c9c3/dbt/include/global_project/macros/utils/escape_single_quotes.sql#L6-L8) - Escaping single quotes within `column` values in Jinja

#### For multiple purposes

* [`adapter.quote`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/adapter#quote) - Applying quoting via the **adapter**-specific macro to a `column` name or individual components of a (`database`, `schema`, `identifier`) combo (or even other database objects like `users` or `roles`) ([source](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/blob/d831caa33bc1a31d1162f1d1b3ccd6caaec08fd5/dbt/adapters/sql/impl.py#L209)).
  + [`quote_as_configured`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/blob/d831caa33bc1a31d1162f1d1b3ccd6caaec08fd5/dbt/adapters/base/impl.py#L909) - Quote or do not quote the given database, schema, or identifier according to the [`quoting`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/project-configs/quoting) project configuration.

### For users / groups / roles in grants

As hinted at in [dbt-labs/dbt-postgres#55](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-postgres/issues/55), we don't have any mechanism to specify that a grant should be quoted. i.e., we don't have a `quote_grants` config.

### What part(s) of the page would you like to see updated?

It would be an improvement to merely cross-link these different pages so that the first result in a Google search is likely to eventually lead where you want to get.

### Additional information

Instigating scenario: [dbt-labs/dbt-core#7832](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/7832)

[dbt-labs/dbt-core#2986](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/2986) aims to unify all of these under a single `quote` config/property, but the earliest that might happen is v1.9+, and we'd want to clarify things for users earlier than that as well.
