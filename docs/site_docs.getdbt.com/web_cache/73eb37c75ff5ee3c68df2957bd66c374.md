Why do model and source YAML files always start with `version: 2`?
==================================================================

Once upon a time, the structure of these `.yml` files was very different (s/o to anyone who was using dbt back then!). Adding `version: 2` allowed us to make this structure more extensible.

From [dbt Core v1.5](/docs/dbt-versions/core-upgrade/Older versions/upgrading-to-v1.5#quick-hits), the top-level `version:` key is optional in all resource YAML files. If present, only `version: 2` is supported.

Also starting in v1.5, both the [`config-version: 2`](/reference/project-configs/config-version) and the top-level `version:` key in the `dbt_project.yml` are optional.

Resource YAML files do not currently require this config. We only support `version: 2` if it's specified. Although we do not expect to update YAML files to `version: 3` soon, having this config will make it easier for us to introduce new structures in the future
