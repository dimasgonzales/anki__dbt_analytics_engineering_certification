# dbt_project.yml  
flags:  
  # set default for running this project -- anywhere, anytime, by anyone  
  fail_fast: true
```

```
# set this environment variable to 'True' (bash syntax)  
export DBT_FAIL_FAST=1  
dbt run
```

```
dbt run --fail-fast # set to True for this specific invocation  
dbt run --no-fail-fast # set to False
```

There are two categories of exceptions:

1. **Flags setting file paths:** Flags for file paths that are relevant to runtime execution (for example, `--log-path` or `--state`) cannot be set in `dbt_project.yml`. To override defaults, pass CLI options or set environment variables (`DBT_LOG_PATH`, `DBT_STATE`). Flags that tell dbt where to find project resources (for example, `model-paths`) are set in `dbt_project.yml`, but as a top-level key, outside the `flags` dictionary; these configs are expected to be fully static and never vary based on the command or execution environment.
2. **Opt-in flags:** Flags opting in or out of [behavior changes](/reference/global-configs/behavior-changes) can *only* be defined in `dbt_project.yml`. These are intended to be set in version control and migrated via pull/merge request. Their values should not diverge indefinitely across invocations, environments, or users.
